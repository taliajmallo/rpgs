# Untitled Cape Hack
## Core Mechanics
### The Core Die Roll
When you try to perform a task with chance of failure, you build a die pool as
follows:
- Start with one die.
- If one of your Traits applies to the roll, add a die.
- For each Tag that applies to the roll on that Trait (and only that trait), add
  a die.
- Spend any amount of Edge to add an equal number of dice.
- If any allies are helping you with this task, each ally may choose to spend an
  Edge to add a single die.

Once you have built your die pool, roll all the dice. Each 4, 5, or 6 (assuming
a 6-sided die) is a hit. You need hits equal to the difficulty level to succeed:
- 2: Easy
- 3: Difficult
- 4: Challenging
- 5: Extreme

If you fail, you don't achieve your goal. However, you are refunded any Edge you
spent, and gain an additional Edge, up to your maximum.

## The Anatomy of a Character
### Traits & Tags
Traits and tags represent your character's skills, connections, and background,
and determine the base number of dice in your die pool for any given action.

Traits are broad categories and one-to-two word descriptors - the first things
that come to mind when you think about your character. Is your character
`Athletic` or `Attractive`? A `Survivor`, a `Burglar`, or an `Ex-Cop`?

Tags are facets of a Trait and/or circumstances where that Trait might apply.
For example, if your character is `Athletic`, are they particularly good at
`Running`? Do they further specialize in `Marathons`? Or are they perhaps more
`Strong` than they are `Fast`?

New characters start with 20 Tags, divided among 4 starting Traits as the player
wishes. Example Traits and corresponding Tags are listed below, but you are also
encouraged to create your own.

### Drives
Drives represent your character's goals, motivations, and life experiences, and
determine how your character gains experience. You gain 1 experience when you
meet the conditions listed on the Drive, plus another 1 experience if your Drive
puts you in danger.

Each Drive also has a Buyoff. If the Buyoff condition occurs, you may choose to
permanently lose the Drive, replace it with a new Drive of your choice, and gain
5 experience.

New characters start with 3 Drives. Example Drives are listed below, but you are
also encouraged to create your own.

- `Drive of the Mission`: You have an objective that defines your personal and/or professional life. Gain experience whenever you take action to complete your mission. Buyoff: Succeed at or abandon your mission.
- `Drive of the Bond`: You have a strong relationship with another character. Gain experience when you are influenced by them or when you show how deep the bond is. Buyoff: Sever the relationship.
- `Drive of Greed`: You like shiny things. Gain experience when you score a big payoff, make a profitable deal, or steal something valuable. Buyoff: Voluntarily donate the majority of your wealth.
- `Drive of Conscience`: You don't like to see anyone suffer, even enemies. Gain experience when you help someone who is in trouble or change someone's life for the better. Buyoff: Ignore a request for help.
- `Drive of the Daredevil`: You thrive in dangerous situations. Gain experience when you do something that is risky or reckless. Buyoff: Be very, very careful.
- `Drive of the Outcast`: You are a pariah, fugitive, or other sort of outcast. Gain experience whenever this status causes you trouble or is important in a scene. Buyoff: Shed your status as an outcast.
- `Drive of Command`: You are accustomed to giving orders and having them obeyed. Gain experience whenever you come up with a plan and give orders to make it happen. Buyoff: Acknowledge someone else as the leader.
- `Drive of Vengeance`: You have been wronged. Only retribution can make this right. Gain experience whenever you strike a blow against the person or group who responsible. Buyoff: Forgive them for what they did to you.
- `Drive of the Warrior`: You crave the crash and roar of battle, the tougher the better. Gain experience whenever you do battle with worthy or superior foes, or unnecessarily start a fight. Buyoff: Pass up an opportunity for a good fight.
- `Drive of the Imposter`: You wear identities like others wear clothes, or live your life under a disguise. Gain experience whenever you pass yourself off as someone you're not. Buyoff: Reveal your true identity to someone you fooled.
- `Drive of Refinement`: You are a cut above the rest. Gain experience when you remind your lessers of your superiority or refuse to stoop to their level. Buyoff: Get over yourself or play dirty.
- `Drive of the Scholar`: You are an eminent mind in your field. Gain experience when you learn or discover something new in your area of interest. Buyoff: Pass up the chance to educate yourself.
- `Drive of the Legacy`: Your parents or mentor blazed a path, for good or for ill. Gain experience when you find yourself following in their footsteps. Buyoff: Refuse this fate.
- `Drive of Vice`: You live to indulge your array of vices. Gain experience when you put this need before other concerns. Buyoff: Stop using.
- `Drive of Service`: You live your life, in part or in whole, for another. Gain experience when you concede to one of their demands against your better judgment or put their needs above your own. Buyoff: Openly refuse them.

- `Drive of the Broker`: You like to make deals and trade favors. Gain experience when you bargain, make a new contact, or exchange a favor. Buyoff: Cut yourself off from your network of contacts.
- `Drive of the Tinkerer`: You just can't leave it alone. Gain experience when you modify, improve, repair, or patch some technology. Buyoff: Pass up the opportunity to mess around with a new piece of tech.
- `Drive of the Vow`: You have a vow of personal behavior that you have sworn not to break. Gain experience when your vow significantly impacts your decisions. Buyoff: Break your vow.

### Knacks
Knacks represent your character's ability to do something exceptional that sets
them apart. This may be due to superior training, to a life hard-lived, or to
having a superpower. Knacks shouldn't need you to roll to perform them, but may
come with a once per scene or once per session restriction as a result.

New characters start with 2 Knacks. Example Knacks are listed below, but you are
also encouraged to make your own.

- `Knack of the Cape`: You have a superpower. Describe the capabilities of your power.
- `Knack of Preparation`: You always have a few essentials on your person, even if searched. You can produce any common, simple item at a moment's notice.
- `Knack of Teamwork`: If you spend Edge to give another player a die, they gain a another die.
- `Knack of Desperation`: When you regain Edge from failing a roll, regain an additional Edge.
- `Knack of Experience`: Once per scene, you may use multiple Traits (and Tags from those Traits) when making a roll.
- `Knack of Aptitude`: Choose a Trait. Once per scene, you may re-roll a failed roll when rolling that Trait.
- `Knack of the Juggernaut`: Once per scene, when you would gain the Injured condition or a similar one, you can gain the Angry condition instead.
- `Knack of the Brawler`: Once per scene, you can tell exactly who present would be easiest to goad into a fight, and roughly how.
- `Knack of the Dilettante`: Once per session, you may give yourself a temporary Trait or Tag that lasts until the next time you use this Knack.
- `Knack of the Lucky Break`: Once per session, you may reset your Edge to its maximum value.
- `Knack of the Socialite`: Once per session, upon meeting a character for the first time, you may declare that you have previously met them before.
- `Knack of Attention`: Once per session, you may draw a crowd to you in minutes.
- `Knack of Infiltration`: Once per session, you may insert yourself into a situation where you are not currently present, so long as you could plausibly appear.
- `Knack of Bargaining`: Once per session, regardless of what it is, you can set up a meeting with a character who will make a deal for it (but not necessarily a favorable one).

### Edge
Edge represents your character's preparation, determination, and luck. It is
mainly used and regained when making die rolls, but some Knacks may interact
with it as well.

Each session, you start with Edge equal to your maximum. Additionally, when you
have downtime, the GM may tell you to reset your Edge to its maximum.

You start with a maximum Edge of 5.

### Experience
Experience may be spent in the following ways:
- 1 Experience: Increase your current Edge by 1, up to your maximum
- 3 Experience: Add a new Tag to any Trait, up to a maximum of 12 Tags per Trait
- 5 Experience: Add a new Trait with 3 Tags, up to a maximum of 6 Traits
- 5 Experience: Add a new Drive, up to a maximum of 5 Drives
- 5 Experience: Add a new Knack, up to a maximum of 5 Knacks
- 5 Experience: Increase your maximum and current Edge by 1, up to 10

### Conditions
When events warrant, such as by failing a roll, the GM may impose a condition on
your character. A condition might increase the difficulty level of a roll, or
may restrict your choice of action (for instance, you can't be reasonable if you
have the Angry condition).

A condition lasts until it wears off or is directly dealt with.

Common conditions may include Injured, Tired, Angry, Shaken, and Incapacitated.
In some situations, it may be appropriate to use more specific conditions, such
as Lost, Hunted, Trapped, Drained, or Bound.
