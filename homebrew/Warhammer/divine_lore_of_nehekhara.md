# Divine Lore of Nehekhara
## Mortuary Cult
Rather than venerate a single deity, the Mortuary Cult calls upon a wide host of
spirits to aid the people of Nehekhara. Most disciples of the cult will bind
themselves to a particular variety of spirit, determining which blessings they
are capable of invoking.

### Note
Many Nehekharan scriptures refer to actions regarding one's kin. In Nehekharan
culture, kinship is a formal arrangement that can be made or broken through
specific rituals. Nehekharan culture does not meaningfully distinguish between
blood kin and chosen kin, or between disowned kin and complete strangers.

### All Spirits
#### Scriptures
All disciples of the Mortuary Cult must obey the following scriptures:
- Respect and protect the dead; never defile a corpse.
- Oppose always the works of the Traitor Prince.
- Serve Settra, king of kings, above all others.
#### Blessings
All disciples of the Mortuary Cult gain access to the following blessings:
Breath | Conscience | Tenacity
#### Miracles
##### Rise, Honored Dead
Range: Fellowship yards
Target: 1 Corpse
Duration: Until sunrise
Beckon a spirit into a nearby corpse, reanimating that which was once dead.
The corpse is reanimated as a Zombie or Skeleton entirely under your control,
and can perform simple orders as you command. The undead starts with the Prone
condition, and if you die or gain an Unconscious condition, the miracle ends
immediately.

### Guardian Spirits
Guardian spirits are those departed souls that dedicate themselves to protecting
their living kin from harm. Those bound to guardian spirits are most represented
in city watches and the military, while temple guards are more often bound to
honor spirits - the preservation of the life of their kin is the primary aim of
a guardian spirit, and so they seldom deem it important to stand watch over an
empty tomb.
#### Scriptures
Those who bind guardian spirits must obey the additional following scriptures:
- Never strike your kin, even in self-defense.
- Stand between your kin and harm, even at the cost of your own health - it is your duty to protect your garden, that your kin may be well within it.
#### Blessings
Those who bind guardian spirits gain access to the additional following blessings:
Battle | Healing | Protection
#### Miracles
##### Hallowed Ground
TODO make area in which undead last longer than sunrise

### Patron Spirits
Patron spirits are those departed souls that would pass their knowledge and
skills on to their living kin. Those bound to patron spirits are typically the
centers of their families or communities - aristocratic patriarchs, esteemed
priests, and respected academics all frequently see their number.
#### Scriptures
Those who bind patron spirits must obey the additional following scriptures:
- Never refuse to share knowledge or belongings with your kin.
- Take up no blade unless you've none to do so in your stead - it is your duty to shape your garden, and the duty of your kin to guard it.
#### Blessings
Those who bind patron spirits gain access to the additional following blessings:
Fortune | Wisdom | Wit
#### Miracles
##### TODO ???
TODO single(?) undead lasts longer

### Honor Spirits
Honor spirits are those departed souls that seek to wreak vengeance upon the
foes of their kin, living or dead. Those bound to honor spirits are often found
among the temple guard, and other such protectors of holy places - an honor
spirit protects not the people of Nehekhara, but its culture.
#### Scriptures
- Never be party to theft - strike off the left hand for a first offense, the right for a second, and the head for a third.
- Any harm visited to your kin must be revisited to the perpetrator and theirs - it is your duty to seek out those who have trespassed in your garden, and end their threat.
#### Blessings
Battle | Righteousness | Savagery
#### Miracles
##### TODO ???
TODO undead vengeance-seeking?
