# Possessed Maiden (Medium Archetype)
Instead of channeling spirits, you draw from your past conditioning and 
training as a Grey Maiden to grant you skill at arms. 

## Proficiencies
Possessed maidens are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all 
types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and with shields (except tower 
shields).
This alters the medium's armor and weapon proficiencies. 

## Class skills
A possessed maiden gains Climb, Knowledge (Geography), Knowledge (History), 
Knowledge (Local), Ride, Survival, and Swim as class skills, but does not gain 
Fly, Knowledge (Arcana), Knowledge (Planes), Linguistics, Spellcraft, or Use 
Magic Device as class skills. This alters the medium's class skills. 

## Conditioning (Ex)
A possessed maiden compulsively resists channeling her prior conditioning, but 
certain triggers (such as violence) can cause her to lapse. The possessed maiden
may use a full-round action to make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her medium level) 
to recall her training; if she fails, she becomes shaken for 1 minute and cannot 
try again during this time. If exposed to mortal peril (such as the start of 
combat), a possessed maiden must succeed at a Will save at the same DC or 
immediately recall her training; she cannot intentionally fail this Will save, 
nor may she voluntarily submit with indoctrination. 

When a possessed maiden recalls her training through this class feature, she 
chooses either the Champion spirit, the Guardian spirit, or the Marshal spirit. 
She gains that spirit's seance boon, influence penalty, and lesser spirit power 
until the next time she becomes unconscious. The possessed maiden also gains the 
spiritâ€™s intermediate spirit power at 6th level, its greater spirit power at 
11th level, and its supreme spirit power at 17th level. While the possessed 
maiden has these benefits, her alignment is considered to be lawful evil for the
purposes of spells and effects, and if the possessed maiden has the Tamed and 
Broken benefit from the Grey Maiden Initiate feat, she gains temporary hitpoints 
equal to a quarter of her medium level (minimum 1). 

The possessed maiden may use a swift action to make a Will save against the same 
DC as earlier to end the effect early; if she fails, she is staggered for 1 
round and cannot end the effect early for the rest of the day. 

Any spirit abilities that affect allies who participated in your seance instead
affect any allies within your line of sight when you gained your seance boon. 

Any spirit abilities that grant the spirit any number of points of influence 
over you instead expend uses of Superior Training equal to the number of points 
of influence. 

This is considered to be a compulsion effect caused by a lawful evil creature, 
regardless of the possessed maiden's alignment. 

This ability replaces Spirit.  

## Superior Training (Ex)
After failing a d20 roll that was modified by her spirit bonus, a possessed 
maiden may add 1d6 to the check's result without taking an action. This may 
cause the check to succeed instead of fail. The possessed maiden must be 
conscious and aware to use this ability, and she may use it at most once per 
round. At 10th level, she may add 1d8 instead, and at 20th level she may add 
1d10 instead. This ability may be used a number of times per day equal to 
the possessed maiden's charisma modifier (minimum 1). 

Any spirit abilities that affect Spirit Surge also affect this ability. 
This ability replaces Spirit Surge, Taboo, Propitiation, and Spirit Mastery. 

## Sisterhood Talents (Ex)
At 1st level and every 2 levels thereafter, you may select a Sisterhood talent
from the list below. Unless otherwise specified, you may not select the same 
talent more than once. 
This ability replaces spellcasting, Haunt Channeler, Location Channel, 
Connection Channel, Ask the Spirits, Astral Journey, and Spacious Soul. 
#### Expanded Training 
Replace one of your spirits with a corresponding Legendary Spirit. For example,
you could replace the Champion spirit with the Butcher spirit. This may be taken
up to three times, selecting a different spirit each time. 
#### Armor Specialization 
Gain the effects of the Armor Training fighter class feature, as if you were
a third-level fighter. You must be a third-level medium to select this talent. 
The talent may be selected multiple times, each time adding four to both the 
effective fighter level and the required mystic level. 
#### Weapon Specialization 
Gain the effects of the Weapon Training fighter class feature, as if you were
a fifth-level fighter. You must be a fifth-level medium to select this talent. 
The talent may be selected multiple times, each time adding four to both the 
effective fighter level and the required mystic level. 
#### Sisterhood Combat 
Gain the Grey Maiden Initiate feat, Sisterhood Style combat feat, or any feat 
that lists either of them as a prerequisite. You must satisfy all prerequisites 
of the feat chosen. This may be taken multiple times, selecting a new feat each 
time. 
#### Shield-Sister
When using a longsword and a heavy shield, you are treated as if you had the 
two-weapon fighting feat. This allows you to take feats that require two-weapon
fighting as a prerequisite without meeting the two-weapon fighting or dexterity
prerequisites, but you only benefit from such feats while using a longsword and
a heavy shield. 
#### Castling 
When you take a 5-foot step, you can step into the space of a willing, adjacent
ally. If you do, that ally immediately takes a 5-foot-step into your former
space without spending an action to do so. 
#### Driving Assault 
When making a full attack, you can take a -2 penalty on melee attack rolls for 
1 round. If you do, the first time in that round that you hit a creature of your 
size or smaller with a melee attack, you can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver 
check to push the creature back 5 feet. You gain a +2 bonus on this combat 
maneuver check and do not provoke attacks of opportunity when performing the 
bull rush, but regardless of the result, you cannot push the target further than 
5 feet. If you push a creature in this way, you can immediately move into its 
space without provoking attacks of opportunity.
#### Merciless Slaughter 
When you hit a cowering or panicked creature with a melee attack, or reduce a 
creature to negative hit points with a melee attack, you may use a swift action
to add your Superior Training die to the damage dealt without spending a daily
use of Superior Training. This still counts as superior training for the purpose 
of the limit of one superior training per round.
#### Persistent Indoctrination 
Whenever you are subjected to a non-harmless compulsion effect that offers a 
Will saving throw, you may choose to voluntarily submit. If you do so, you 
automatically fail your saving throw, and the effect's duration (if any) is 
doubled, but you gains a bonus to Will saves equal to your Charisma modifier 
for the duration of the compulsion. 

## Bonds of Sisterhood (Ex)
At 2nd level, a possessed maiden grants her current seance boon to all adjacent 
allies. At 5th level, she grants her current seance boon to all allies within
30 feet who can see and hear her instead. 
This ability replaces Shared Seance. 

## Versatile Combatant (Ex)
At 10th level, before a possessed maiden makes a Will save to end conditioning 
early, she may choose a spirit she has access to and is not currently using. If 
she succeeds on the Will save, instead of ending the effect early, she replaces 
her current spirit's seance boon, influence penalty, and spirit powers with the 
new spirit's. If she fails, she may not attempt to end the effect early or use 
versatile combatant for the next hour, but does not suffer any of the other
penalties from failing to end the effect early. 

## Mixed Tactics (Ex)
At 15th level, as a swift action, a possessed maiden expend one use of Superior
Training to gain the intermediate spirit power of her Champion, Guardian, or 
Marshal spirit for one round per level. This may be used during conditioning 
to gain a second spirit's intermediate power. 
This ability replaces Trance of Three. 

## Paragon Training (Ex)
At 20th level, whenever a possessed maiden chooses a spirit to channel for 
conditioning, she may instead choose to channel all three simultaneously, 
gaining each of their seance boons, influence penalties, and spirit powers. 
This ability replaces Astral Beacon.
