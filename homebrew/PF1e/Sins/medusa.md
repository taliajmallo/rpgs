# Lesser Medusa - 20 RP
Medusi are usually considered to be a race of monsters, feared and reviled for their petrifying gaze and potent venom.
They resemble beautiful women of whichever race they or their bloodline's matriarch once belonged to, but can be recognized for their true nature by their entirely-black eyes and their hair made of serpents. 

The matriarchs of each medusa bloodline are women who once worshipped the goddess of love and beauty, but then transgressed against their faith in some irredeemable manner. The goddess cursed each of them with a monstrous visage, to forever mark the medusa as a danger to be shunned, and to only ever bear daughters as monstrous as they are. 

Most medusi matriarchs live solitary lives, never again taking a lover or family. However, some have founded tribes in the Bla'Kroya desert, where they stubbornly try to rebuild the lives that were torn from them. 

Lesser Medusi, in particular, are the recently-cursed matriarchs and the orphaned daughters of other medusi. They are visually indistinguishable from their more powerful kin, but they have not yet trained with their gaze for its effects to be permanent. 

## Core Traits
Medusi are monstrous humanoids, and usually have a size of medium. They have a movement speed of 30 feet, and have darkvision with a range of 60 feet. 

All medusi gain +2 to their Constitution and Charisma ability scores. 

## Racial Traits
 - All-Around Vision (Ex)
Medusi can see through their snake hair's eyes, granting them a +4 racial bonus on Perception checks and making them immune to flanking.

 - Petrifying Gaze (Su)
Non-medusi within 30 feet of a medusa that meet her gaze must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + the 1/2 user's character level + the user's Charisma modifier) or stand petrified for 1 round. A target that successfully saves cannot be affected by the user's petrifying gaze for 24 hours.

 - Poison Resistance (Ex)
Medusi gain a racial bonus on saving throws against poison effects equal to their Hit Dice.

- Poison Use (Ex)
Medusi are skilled with poison and never risk accidentally poisoning themselves when applying it to weapons.

 - Toxic (Ex)
A number of times per day equal to her Constitution modifier (minimum 1/day), a medusa can envenom a weapon that she wields with her toxic saliva or blood (using blood requires the medusa to be injured when she uses this ability). Applying venom in this way is a swift action. 
Life-Stealing Venom: Injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the user's Hit Dice + the user's Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1 Con; cure 1 save.

 - Unnatural (Su)
Medusi are divinely cursed to unnerve others, even when disguising their monstrous features. They take a –4 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks, except for Intimidate, to affect creatures of the animal or humanoid type. Animals' starting attitude toward medusi is one step worse than normal.
