      "description": "Designed in the field by a team of [Redacted] operators stranded on the planet of [Redacted] during a crisis response mission, the Boudica is a thorough refit of an outdated Harrison Armory Barbarossa precursor using technology ripped from a modern Monarch chassis. This frame is designed to serve as a mobile base of operations when operating behind enemy lines or far away from any of the creature comforts personnel might expect from a base or camp. In order to expand the Barbarossa’s already considerable frame, the massive Apocalypse rail had to be removed and the proto-Barbarossa’s impressive armor had to be reduced to allow it to cover the greater mass. [Redacted] compensated for the Apocalypse Rail’s removal by developing the RWDR system and paired it with an NHP designed from [Redacted] to allow it to still serve as a potent artillery piece when battle is joined. A colonist by the name of [Redacted] almost fully replaced the Boudica’s outdated computer and sensor system with those of the Monarch making it a force to be reckoned with on the modern battlefield. It must be noted that the Boudica is a violation of Harrison Armory and Smith-Shimano intellectual property. Printing the Boudica is a crime under international law, and the print shop, operators, and any license holders may be held legally responsible.",
