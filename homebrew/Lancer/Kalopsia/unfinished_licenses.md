### Frame Trait: Hazard Seeking Routines
Whenever you attack a target with at least one condition, your attack gains the
Smart tag against that target (but not other targets lacking conditions, if the
attack affects multiple targets).
### Frame Trait: IFF Protocol
Whenever you make an attack that has the Smart tag, you may choose to miss your
target automatically. Whenever you make an attack that affects multiple targets,
you may choose to automatically miss all targets for which the attack lacks the
Smart tag.
### Frame Trait: ???
When you make an attack that deals damage to at least one target that has at
least one condition, choose a single condition from a single target hit. All
other targets hit must make an Agility save or gain that condition until the end
of their next turn.
