- Initiating another into occult magic
- Curse another

## Tier 1
### Boon: Changeling's Call
Gain the Changeling trait and low-light vision if you do not already have either of them. Gain the first-level changeling ancestry Feat corresponding to your hag lineage (e.g., Moon May). If you already have that feat, instead gain a fifth-level changeling ancestry feat.
### Bane: Hagmarked
As specified in the changeling ancestry feat, one of your eyes becomes a solid orb of a single, unnatural color that signifies your hag lineage.


## Tier 2
### Boon: Lesser Hag's Prowess
Gain a fifth-level changeling ancestry feat. If you already have at least one fifth-level changeling ancestry feat, you may instead gain a ninth-level or lower changeling ancestry feat.
### Bane: Hag's Visage
Both of your eyes now resemble a hag's, and you gain a subtle tell pertaining to your hag lineage. For example, if you are transforming into a moon hag, any illumination on you might look like moonlight; if you're a sea hag, your hair may flow as if underwater at all times.


## Tier 3
### Boon: Greater Hag's Prowess
Gain a ninth-level changeling ancestry feat. If you already have at least one ninth-level changeling ancestry feat, you may instead gain a thirteenth-level or lower changeling ancestry feat.
### Bane: Hag's Aura
You gain Weakness 5 to Cold Iron, and discord follows in your wake. Those you speak with will find it easier to become argumentative, and nettles or other stinging plants will grow in natural areas you walk through. You gain a more blatant tell pertaining to your hag lineage that appears when you cast an occult spell. For example, if you're transforming into a night hag you may temporarily drain the color out of your surroundings, or if you are transforming into a blood hag your veins and arteries may glow a bright crimson.

## Tier 4
### Boon: True Hag's Prowess
Gain a thirteenth-level changeling ancestry feat. If you already have at least one thirteenth-level changeling ancestry feat, you may instead gain a seventeenth-level or lower changeling ancestry feat.
### Bane: Hag's Burden
You gain Weakness 10 to Cold Iron, and gain the Hag trait. The discord you bring infects you as well, and you become inclined towards immediate and severe vengeance. Whenever you feel betrayed, deliberately thwarted, or humiliated by another, gain 1 point of Grudge and write down the name of the person responsible in a dedicated area of your character sheet called the Litany of Grudges. The same name can be added to the Litany of Grudges multiple times. When your Grudge value reaches 10, reset it to zero and circle a name you've written down. Until you cross the name off by viciously and brutally settling accounts with the selected individual, you gain Doomed 1, or increase your Doomed value by 1 if you already have that condition, and cannot reduce your Doomed value by any means. Proportional retribution is insufficient; regardless of the offense, your retribution must be in the "your screams will crack your throat" range.
