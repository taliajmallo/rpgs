# Kineticist Class Archetype: Bloodmoon Kineticist
## Blood-Moon Gate (1st)
Your kinetic gate connects you not to one of the elemental planes, but to the
the domain of a power known as the Moon-Mother.

**Prerequisites**: You must be a Kineticist who choose a single gate.

If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Bloodmoon Dedication as
your 2nd-level class feat.

**Adjustments**: You gain access to the Lunar element, and must choose it as
your element at first level. You may not choose to Fork the Path at higher
levels. Replace the Primal trait with the Occult trait on any kineticist feats
or actions, and gain training in Occult instead of training in Nature.

## Bloodmoon Dedication (Feat 2)

other feats from the Bloodmoon Kineticist archetype or impulse feats from the
Lunar element.
