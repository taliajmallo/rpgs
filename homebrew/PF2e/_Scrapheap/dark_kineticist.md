# Curse-Warped Kineticist

## Cursed Gate (1st)
Where other kineticists open conduits to the Elemental Planes, your inner gate
was forcibly redirected to a more sinister destination. Your body channels dark
forces, granting the potential for great power at the ongoing risk of destroying
your very soul.

If you choose this class archetype, you must select the Curse-Warped Dedication
as your 2nd-level class feat.

**Prerequisites**: You must be a kineticist.

**Curse-Warped Adjustments**: Your inner gate must be a dedicated gate,
connecting to the curse element (see below). You may channel the curse element,
and gain access to curse impulses. Replace the Primal trait on any kineticist
actions with the Occult trait. Replace the Evocation and Transmutation traits on
any kineticist actions with the Necromancy trait. Any kineticist ability that
works on creatures with the elemental trait or creatures with a specific
elemental nature instead works on undead.


Curse blast deals 1d6 negative damage. If melee, it has the agile, finesse, and
curse traits; if ranged, it has the agile, curse, and range increment 60
feet traits. When you gain the Critical Element class feature, the curse
critical specialization effect is that the target must succeed at a Fortitude
save against your class DC or be drained 1.


Instead of Adapt Element, you gain Consuming Curse.
*Consuming Curse*:
Your soul is slowly fragmenting due to the warped nature of your
inner gate, but you've learned to use this dark hunger for your own ends. After
getting a full night's rest, increase your hunger value by 1. Whenever you
reduce a creature of your level or higher to 0 Hit Points using negative damage
or Extract Element, you may decrease your hunger value by 1. When you use an
impulse that has a damage roll, it gains a status bonus to its damage equal to
half your Constitution modifier against creatures that are below their full Hit
Points.

*Hunger*:
If you have the hunger condition, you do not reduce your drained value when
getting a full night's rest. Instead, increase your drained value by 1, to a
maximum of your hunger value.


Instead of Adapt Terrain, you gain Ravenous Incarnation.
*Ravenous Incarnation*: >>
[Curse] [Impulse] [Kinetic Aura] [Kineticist] [Necromancy] [Negative] [Occult]
Give way to your dark cravings, and draw your hunger out around you. Increase
your hunger value by 1. Whenever a creature of your level or higher within the
aura is reduced to 0 Hit Points, you may decrease your hunger value by 1. Any
creature other than you that enters the aura or ends its turn there takes 4
negative damage.
Level (+3) The maximum damage increases by 2.


Instead of Pure Adaptation, you gain Consume Curse.
*Consume Curse*: >>>
[Concentrate] [Kineticist] [Necromancy] [Occult]
Attempt to counteract a curse on a creature, item, or location within touch
range, using your class DC - 10 for the counteract check. If you successfully
counteract the curse, reduce your hunger value by 1. If you fail to counteract
the curse, any further attempt you make to counteract it fails as well, and if
you critically fail to counteract the curse, you become subject to it as well.



## Curse-Warped Dedication
[Rare] [Archetype] [Class] [Dedication]
When determining the effects of the drained condition, treat your drained value
as 1 lower for all calculations.

Special You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other
feats from the curse-warped archetype.
