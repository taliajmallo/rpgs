# Metaphagy
The following Unconscious Mind and Conscious Mind are intended for use together,
but can be used with any Psychic character.

## Unconscious Mind: Soul Subsumption
An emptiness in your soul awakened you to your ability to reach out to feel
other souls and interact with them, and these interactions can produce all
manners of useful phenomena.

Your thought components are connections with nearby souls, which you manipulate
to cause effects on the world. You might violently agitate a cluster of souls
to produce an explosion of flame about them, or gently hold a soul to soothe its
corresponding body. Connection components tend to manifest as phantasmal tethers
or beams of light between you and the targets of your spells, or between you and
those near you for spells that don't effect a single other target.

**Key Ability**: Your key ability score is Wisdom.
**Psyche Action**: Sympathetic Tether
*Ravenous Incarnation*: >
[Necromancy] [Psyche] [Psychic]
You and an ally within 30 feet both Step or Stride. You must move in the same
direction, and if you Stride, you must move the same distance as one another.

**Psyche Feat**: Joint Tether, Psychic 10th level feat.
*Joint Tether*: >
[Necromancy] [Psyche] [Psychic]
Until the start of your next turn, whenever you gain temporary HP from a psychic
spell you cast, you may grant an ally within 30 feet the same temporary HP, as
if they had cast the spell themselves.


## Conscious Mind: Consuming Hunger
Hunger sustains you. You reach out and devour, as is your want, as is your right.

When you use an action that has the mindshift trait, you can choose to target
souls instead of minds. Replace any damage it deals with negative damage, give
it the negative trait, and replace any save it requires with a Fortitude save.
The action loses any traits matching damage types it no longer deals.

**Granted Spells** 1st Grim Tendrils; 2nd Death Knell; 3rd Vampiric Touch; 4th Enervation; 5th Rip the Spirit; 6th Vampiric Exsanguination; 7th Finger of Death; 8th Spiritual Epidemic; 9th Voracious Gestalt
**Standard Psi Cantrips** Chill Hand and Sigil
**Unique Psi Cantrips** Surface: Devour Soul; Deeper: ???; Deepest: ???

### Chill Hand
Increase the range to 30 feet. Undead targets take mental damage equal to 1d4
plus your spellcasting modifier, using their save against the flat-footed effect
as a basic Fortitude save against this damage.
*Heightened (+1)* The mental damage to undead creatures also increases by 1d4.
*Amp* The target is treated as both undead and living for the effects of this
cantrip, using a single Fortitude save for both the negative damage and the
mental damage.

### Sigil
You always know the approximate direction and distance to any existing sigils
you have, and may change them from visible to invisible at any distance by using
an Interact action to concentrate on the sigil you want to change.
*Amp* This sigil must be placed on a creature, and fades the next time you
Refocus. You may determine your spells' line of effect and sight from this sigil
instead of yourself.

### Devour Soul
[Uncommon] [Cantrip] [Necromancy] [Negative] [Psychic]
**Cast** >> Somatic, Verbal
**Range** 60 feet, **Targets** 1 creature
