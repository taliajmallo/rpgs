# Moon-Mother
The moon has stilled in the sky, but in the frigid lands far to the north,
priestesses still call upon her power, and witches still seek her out for
tutelage. Before the return of magic, countless small communities worshipped her
in their own ways, with wide-ranging and even conflicting interpretations of how
to best do so, but the advent of divine magic resulted in the gradual merger of
such sects into a cohesive faith centered around community.
