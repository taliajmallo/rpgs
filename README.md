This repository contains resources for pen-and-paper roleplaying games,
particularly character sheets. I recommend VS Code with the Markdown All In One
extension for viewing and editing purposes.

If you are a player in a campaign I am GMing, please have the courtesy to not
peek in any relevant planning folders.
