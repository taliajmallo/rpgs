## Talents
### Skytouched
You grew up around pegasi, and feel as comfortable riding one aloft as you do on
a terrestrial steed. If your career contains any grouped skills with a
specialization in horses (for example, the Knight's Ride (Horse) or the
Coachman's Animal Training (Horse)), you also gain that skill specialized in
pegasi as a career skill, and any talents of yours that apply to horses also
apply to pegasi. However, you are accustomed to the intelligence of a pegasus
mount, and frequently confuse less-bright horses with your behavior - suffer a
-1 SL penalty to any skill specialized in horses.
### Animal Affinity
Max: Willpower Bonus
Tests: Charm Animal
Wild animals feel comfortable in your presence, and often follow your lead. All
creatures with the Bestial Trait not trained to be belligerent will
automatically be calm in your presence unless they have a reason not to be, such
as pain, an attack, being naturally hyper-aggressive, or having nearby young.
### Attractive
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Charm Tests to influence those attracted to you
Whether it's your piercing eyes, your strong frame, or maybe the way you flash
your perfect teeth, you know how to make the best use of what the gods gave you.
When you successfully use Charm to influence those attracted to you, you can
choose to either use your rolled SL, or the number rolled on your units die. So,
a successful roll of 38 could be used for +8 SL.
### Noble Blood
Max: 1
Tests: Any Test influenced by your Status
You are either born into the nobility, or otherwise elevated to it by in-game
events. Assuming you are dressed appropriately, you are always considered of
higher Status than others unless they also have the Noble Blood Talent, where
Status is compared as normal.
### Read/Write
Max: 1
You are literate in any language you can speak.
### Suave
Max: 1
You gain a permanent +5 bonus to your starting Fellowship Characteristic (this
does not count towards your Advances).
### Roughrider
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Ride (Horse) when in combat
You are at home in the saddle in even the most difficult of circumstances, and
know how to get the best out of your mount during conflict. Assuming you have
the Ride skill, you can direct your mount to take an Action, not just a Move,
without a Ride test
