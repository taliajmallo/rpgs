## Talents
### Bless (Mortuary Cult, Patron Spirits)
Max: 1
You are watched over by one of the Gods and can empower simple prayers. You can
now employ the Blessings of your deity. Under normal circumstances, you may only
ever know one Divine Lore for the Bless Talent.
### Child of the Necropolis
Max: 1
Continued proximity to necromancy has suffused you with Shyish. Aggressive
animals in your presence gain Animosity towards you, while other animals gain
Fear I towards you. However, undead do not detect you as living, but rather,
perceive you to be undead. Unintelligent undead will not attack you unless
ordered or provoked, and intelligent undead will assume that you are one of them.
### Read/Write
Max: 1
You are one of the rare literate individuals in the Old World. You are assumed
to be able to read and write (if appropriate) all of the Languages you can speak.
### Suave
Max: 1

Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Intuition Tests to detect Wizards
You are able to sense the Winds of Magic in others. You may attempt an Average

### Noble Blood
Max: 1
Tests: Any Test influenced by your Status
You are either born into the nobility, or otherwise elevated to it by in-game
events. Assuming you are dressed appropriately, you are always considered of
higher Status than others unless they also have the Noble Blood Talent, where
Status is compared as normal.
### Artistic
Max: Dexterity Bonus
Tests: Art (Any)
You have a natural talent for art, able to produce precise sketches with nothing
but time and appropriate media. This ability has several in-game uses, ranging
from creating Wanted Posters to sketching accurate journals, and has spot
benefits as determined by the GM. Further to this, add Art (Any) to any Career
you enter; if it is already in Career, you may instead purchase the Skill for 5
XP fewer per Advance.
