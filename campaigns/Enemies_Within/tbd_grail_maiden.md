## Talents
### Herald of the Lady
The Lady of the Lake has marked you to be an agent of her will in far-off lands,
and granted a boon to help you in such endeavors. Your very breath and voice are
infused with the Winds of Magic - any words you speak are heard by all in their
own native languages, and their words are heard by you in yours. Even the
eldritch language of magic, used to bend the Winds to your will, sounds to all
as if you were simply beseeching the Lady of the Lake for aid or calling upon
her blessings. You may use Language (Magic) in place of any speech-dependent
Fellowship-based skill tests.
However, this phenomenon is unsettling to those familiar with the winds, or
resistant to their effects. Any creature with the Magic Resistance trait or
advances in Channeling (Any) can subconsciously tell that your voice is
enchanted, and you suffer a -20 penalty on all Fellowship-based
(speech-dependent or otherwise) tests and opposed tests against such individuals.
Some may additionally gain Animosity towards you, if they are particularly
hostile to magic or if they believe you to be acting in a particularly
manipulative and bewitching manner.
### Petty Magic
You are capable of casting spells, and have mastered techniques to cast them.
You permanently memorize a number of spells equal to your Willpower bonus (4).
You may learn additional spells for experience, at a cost of 50 XP * (Spells
known / Willpower bonus, rounded up).
### Perfect Pitch
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Entertain (Sing), Language (Tonal Languages, such as Elthárin, Cathayan)
You have perfect pitch, able to replicate notes perfectly and identify them
without even making a Test. Further, add Entertain (Sing) to any Career you
enter; if it is already in your Career, you may instead purchase the Skill for
5 XP fewer per Advance.
### Noble Blood
Max: 1
Tests: Any Test influenced by your Status
You are either born into the nobility, or otherwise elevated to it by in-game
events. Assuming you are dressed appropriately, you are always considered of
higher Status than others unless they also have the Noble Blood Talent, where
Status is compared as normal.
### Read/Write
You are literate in any language you can speak.
### Suave
Max: 1
You gain a permanent +5 bonus to your starting Fellowship Characteristic (this
does not count towards your Advances).
### Orientation
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Navigation
You have an instinctual feel for direction. You automatically know which
direction is north with a glimpse at the stars, trees, or whatever other signs
you are familiar with.

## Spells
### Magic Missiles
Reverse the dice to determine hit location (magic missiles always hit, if cast
successfully). They deal base damage equal to the test's SL plus your Willpower
bonus, in addition to any additional damage from the spell, and are mitigated
as normal by the target's Toughness and Armor.
### Petty Spells
#### "May You Be Struck Down by the Lady's Wrath!"
- CN: 0
- Range: Willpower yards
- Target: 1
- Duration: Instant
The target is briefly and suddenly set alight with brilliant white flames,
causing damage and injury. These flames are not actual fire, though, and do not
set any flammable objects or creatures alight - they simply cause magical damage
to the creature as a demonstration of the wrath of the Lady of the Lake. This is
a magic missile with a Damage of +0.
#### "By the Lady's Grace, May Secrets be Laid Bare."
- CN: 0
- Range: Willpower yards
- Target: Special
- Duration: Willpower minutes
Calling upon the Lady of the Lake's aid, you survey the surrounding area for
oddities and illusions. 'Unnatural' predatory or non-native plants such as
damaging molds and fungi, Chaos plants and creatures, Corrupted beings, Daemonic
entities, and hostile illusions will be seen for what they really are. You come
to know the location and type of any non-magical traps and small constructions
within Range. Also, you gain a +1 SL bonus to successful Charm Animal and Track
Tests for the duration of the spell.
#### "Blessed Lady, Speak to Me of This Place."
- CN: 0
- Range: You
- Target: You
- Duration: Willpower Bonus minutes
You commune with the Lady of the Lake for the duration of the spell, learning of
your surroundings. You may ask a single question per minute of the spell’s
Duration about the surrounding area and local events, and if an answer can be
provided, it is given honestly and without bias. Only you may hear these answers.
#### "Blessed Lady, Reveal to Me This Foe!"
- CN: 0
- Range: Willpower yards
- Target: 1
- Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds+
You point at one target and trace its shape, setting it alight with harmless
white flames that outline and reveal it. All combat Tests against the outlined
creature gain +1 Advantage. Note: This spell may have uses other than direct
combat. For example, your GM may agree that an angry mob may react to an
outlined character with hostility, or guards may detain the outlined character
for questioning.
