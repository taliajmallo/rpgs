## Talents
### Thaumaturge of Saphery
Gain *Psychology [Obsessive Magick Disorder]*. If you can carry out a task using
magic, you must succeed on a Difficult (-10) Cool test first to accomplish it
without magic. Many of the common folk of the old World can subconsciously feel
your magical nature and are even more suspicious of you than of other elves.
Anyone who has a prejudice against magic, wizards, elves and similar categories
acts as if under Animosity towards you. You only miscast non-damaging Petty
Spells on a roll of 88 and 100, but then must roll on the major miscast table
for the outcome. Additionally, you know two more Petty Spells at character
creation.
### Petty Magic
You are capable of casting spells, and have mastered techniques to cast them.
You permanently memorize a number of spells equal to your Willpower bonus (5).
You may learn additional spells for experience, at a cost of 50 XP * (Spells
known / Willpower bonus, rounded up).
### Acute Sense I (Sight)
Max: Initiative Bonus
Test: Perception (Sense)
One of your primary five senses is highly developed, allowing you to spot what
others miss. You may take Perception Tests to detect normally imperceptible
details with the associated sense, as dictated by the GM. For example, this
could include seeing an eagle beyond everyone else's eyeshot.
### Night Vision I
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Perception tests in low-light conditions
You can see very well in natural darkness. Assuming you have at least a faint
source of light (such as starlight, moonlight, or bioluminescence) you can see
clearly for 20 yards per level of Night Vision. Further, you can extend the
effective illumination distance of any light sources by 20 yards per level of
Night Vision.
### Second Sight I
Max: Initiative Bonus
Tests: Any Test to detect the Winds of Magic
You can see the shifting Winds of Magic. This manifests visually, as wisps of
color in the air that drift around as if like smoke.
### Strong-Minded I
Max: Willpower Bonus
Gain +1 max resolve.
### Read/Write
You are literate in any language you can speak.

## Spells
### Ingredients
You have 5 ingredients currently, and due to spoilage, you may only maintain a
maximum of 5 locally sourced ingredients (though you may purchase additional
ingredients with preservatives). When casting spells, you may use one of these
ingredients to downgrade any miscasts by one rank of severity, or to remove the
chance of corruption for miscasting a petty spell. Alternately, you may use an
ingredient to enhance a spell's power, allowing you to reverse the casting roll
if desired. However, if the units die exceeds your Willpower bonus, you lose
control and suffer a minor miscast.
### Magic Missiles
Reverse the dice to determine hit location (magic missiles always hit, if cast
successfully). They deal base damage equal to the test's SL plus your Willpower
bonus, in addition to any additional damage from the spell, and are mitigated
as normal by the target's Toughness and Armor.
### Petty Spells
#### Conjure Critter
- CN: 0
- Range: Touch
- Target: Special
- Duration: Instant
You reach into a bag, pocket, or hat, or under a rock, bush or burrow, producing
a small animal of a type you would expect to find in the vicinity, such as a
rabbit, dove, or rat. If there are no appropriate local animals, the spell does
nothing. The temperament of the animal is not guaranteed. Special: As a caster
of unsavory magicks, you may butcher the small animal to produce SL ingredients.
#### Dictate
- CN: 0
- Range: Touch
- Target: Special
- Duration: Special
A disembodied voice will read aloud, without translation or inflection, the text
of one document, scroll, book, sign, or similar writing in a slow, clear manner
that nearby people can hear. Once begun, the whole text will be read aloud and
cannot be stopped without dispelling the spell. Listeners can make an Easy (+40)
Intelligence Test to memorize the information read, with a cumulative penalty of
-10 for every 10 minutes spent listening. The spell will not activate or help
you memorize magical effects, summonings, prayers, and the like.
#### Guiding Winds
- CN: 0
- Range: Willpower yards
- Target: Special
- Duration: Willpower Bonus minutes
Through the Winds of Magic, you are able to locate one lost object within range.
If the object does not belong to you, it must have been touched by a living
person who seeks to find it, and you must touch that person while casting the
spell.
#### Light of the Fell Moon
- CN: 0
- Range: Willpower yards
- Target: 1
- Duration: Instant
You cause a small dart of magical energy to fly from your fingers.
This is a magic missile with a Damage of +0.
#### Spark of Potential
- CN: 0
- Range: You
- Target: You
- Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
You kindle a small flame that flickers to life in the palm of your hand. It will
not burn you, but will emit heat and set flammable objects alight, like a
natural flame.
#### Tongue of the Lost
- CN: 3
- Range: You
- Target: You
- Duration: Willpower minutes
You may speak and understand the Beast Tongue of the Beastmen, even without the
corresponding skill.
#### Vouchsafe
- CN: 0
- Range: 1 yard
- Target: Special
- Duration: Instant
You channel magic into an object, noticing immediately if it has been poisoned
or trapped.
