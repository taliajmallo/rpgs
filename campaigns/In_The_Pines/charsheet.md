## Characteristics
### Essence
Once per scene, you may regain 2 points of essence if a specific person believes
you about how the world should be / how it was for you. You also regain 3 + your
Essence points of essence at sunset, and regain 1 point of essence if you begin
a scene with 0 essence. All essence gained in these ways may be split between
black and white essence at will.
### Intimacies
Attempts to subvert an intimacy allow you to make a Willpower roll against
difficulty 8 to resist, even if you already failed to resist a supernatural
power. Once per session, when you act to strongly support or affirm one of your
intimacies, you may regain a point of willpower.

- Max Statler (Romantic Love)
- The world is horrifying.
### Getimian Alchemy

### Limit
#### Gaining Limit
Gain one Limit whenever you:
- Botch a roll
- Undermine or betray your Nature or an Intimacy
- Encounter a person who should recognize you but doesn't (1/person/story)
- Encounter a place or thing that should be different (1/thing/story)
- End a scene with one essence pool empty and the other at 3+ Essence
#### Consequence: Discordant Burn
Roll Limit against difficulty 6, then reset Limit to zero. Take an amount of
aggravated damage equal to the successes. You cannot spend essence this turn.
#### Consequence: Discordant Flaw
Roll Limit against difficulty 6, then reset Limit to zero. Suffer a Discordant
Flaw based on the number of successes, as follows, and lose access to your
Getimian Alchemy while the flaw persists:
- 0: Your anima pulses into visibility, then fades away.
- 1-2: Something about the world in your presence is wrong for a short while. Watches may count backwards in your presence, sounds may be distorted, or the air may carry a heavy whiff of industrial fumes. These changes last a scene or two.
- 3-4: Gravity, time, or space around you suddenly misbehave in unpredictable ways, giving periodic +1 difficulty penalties. These changes come and go for at least a day.
- 5-6: The effects of the previous two levels persist for several days. Additionally, people intermittently misidentify you as being someone else they have strong feelings about.
- 7-8: In addition to the effects of all previous levels, people develop new and false memories of you that paint you in a sinister light. These memories fade when Discordant Flaw ends. Previous effects become more pronounced, inflicting +2 difficulty penalties.
- 9-10: All previously mentioned effects persist for at least a week, at intense and near-constant severity. The alteration of memories is more significant and wide-ranging, and the memories do not fade away.
#### Discordant Spirit
Your limit track empties, and a Paradox Spirit manifests, looking to deal with
you as it would any other severe ongoing deviation from reality. Until the
spirit is dealt with in some way, you cannot access your Getimian Alchemy.
#### Discordant Soul
Your limit track empties, and the friction between your nature and reality
drives your essence in on itself, plunging you into a delusional mindscape. Your
thoughts and perceptions twist, telling you that the world is returned to the
shape it should hold - that you are back in the world you left behind. At
Essence 3+, these delusions even spill out into the world around you. This
persists for a number of days equal to your Essence, during which Getimian
Alchemy is unavailable.
### Getimian Alchemy
You can overlay a "template destiny" on yourself by gaining a limit and spending
a turn concentrating; this template lasts until another is used or you suffer
Discordant Backlash.
#### The Ewer [ ]
Your Wits, Alertness, and Awareness are increased to 3, and your Perception is
increased to 2. You may reflexively spend 1 essence when an ally's roll fails,
causing reality to stutter-step backwards for a few moments, allowing them to
attempt the roll again. Some variety of flowers appear on your person.
#### The Sorcerer [ ]
Your Manipulation, Wits, Occult, and Subterfuge are increased to 3. Choose
another sort of supernatural being that you have heard of. WHen your anima
banner manifests, instead of its usual appearance, it gives the outward
appearance of being that sort of supernatural being. Your charms disguise
themselves as characteristic powers of whatever being you're impersonating. Some
cosmetic decorations of a rare and precious substance appear on your person.
#### The Corpse [ ]
Your Stamina, Manipulation, and Empathy increase to 3, and your Security and
Performance increase to 2. If you play dead, you will always fool anyone with
such thoroughness that they feel no need to test, even if you've already fooled
them recently. A butterfly emblem of some variety appears on your person.
#### The Crow [ ]
Your Manipulation, Intimidation, and Subterfuge increase to 3, and your Wits,
Melee, and Security increase to 2. Once per scene, you may reflexively change
your Nature, either back to its original value or to any callous Nature that
cares only about itself. Black feathers appear on your person.
