## Characteristics
### Essence
Once per scene, you may regain 2 points of essence if a specific person believes
you about how the world should be / how it was for you. You also regain 3 + your
Essence points of essence at sunset, and regain 1 point of essence if you begin
a scene with 0 essence. All essence gained in these ways may be split between
black and white essence at will.
Your anima banner is a series of black and white churning halos. The proportion
of black to white and the violence of the churning is dependent on how much of
each type of anima you've spent this turn.
### Intimacies
Attempts to subvert an intimacy allow you to make a Willpower roll against
difficulty 8 to resist, even if you already failed to resist a supernatural
power. Once per session, when you act to strongly support or affirm one of your
intimacies, you may regain a point of willpower.
- Autumn Moore (Sisterly Love)
- Max Statler (Romantic Love)
- The world is horrifying, but I will make it kinder.
### Limit
#### Gaining Limit
Gain one Limit whenever you:
- Botch a roll
- Undermine or betray your Nature or an Intimacy
- Encounter a person who should recognize you but doesn't (1/person/story)
- Encounter a place or thing that should be different (1/thing/story)
- End a scene with one essence pool empty and the other at 3+ Essence
#### Consequence: Discordant Flaw
Roll Limit against difficulty 6, then reset Limit to zero. Suffer a Discordant
Flaw based on the number of successes, as follows, and lose access to your
Getimian Alchemy while the flaw persists:
##### 0:
Your anima pulses into visibility, then fades away.
##### 1-2:
Something about the world in your presence is wrong for a short while. Watches
may count backwards in your presence, sounds may be distorted, or the air may
carry a heavy whiff of industrial fumes. These changes last a scene or two.
##### 3-4:
Gravity, time, or space around you suddenly misbehave in unpredictable ways,
giving periodic +1 difficulty penalties. These changes come and go for at least
a day.
##### 5-6:
The effects of the previous two levels persist for several days. Additionally,
people intermittently misidentify you as being someone else they have strong
feelings about.
##### 7-8:
In addition to the effects of all previous levels, people develop new and false
memories of you that paint you in a sinister light. These memories fade when
Discordant Flaw ends. Previous effects become more pronounced, inflicting +2
difficulty penalties.
##### 9-10:
All previously mentioned effects persist for at least a week, at intense and
near-constant severity. The alteration of memories is more significant and
wide-ranging, and the memories do not fade away.
#### Consequence: Discordant Spirit
Your limit track empties, and a Paradox Spirit manifests, looking to deal with
you as it would any other severe ongoing deviation from reality. Until the
spirit is dealt with in some way, you cannot access your Getimian Alchemy.
#### Consequence: Discordant Soul
Your limit track empties, and the friction between your nature and reality
drives your essence in on itself, plunging you into a delusional mindscape. Your
thoughts and perceptions twist, telling you that the world is returned to the
shape it should hold - that you are back in the world you left behind. At
Essence 3+, these delusions even spill out into the world around you. This
persists for a number of days equal to your Essence, during which Getimian
Alchemy is unavailable.
### Getimian Alchemy
You can overlay a "template destiny" on yourself by gaining a limit and spending
a turn concentrating; this template lasts until another is used or you suffer
Discordant Backlash.
#### The Ewer [x]
Your Wits, Alertness, and Awareness are increased to 3, and your Perception is
increased to 2. You may reflexively spend 1 essence when an ally's roll fails,
causing reality to stutter-step backwards for a few moments, allowing them to
attempt the roll again. Some variety of flowers appear on your person.
#### The Sorcerer [ ]
Your Manipulation, Wits, Occult, and Subterfuge are increased to 3. Choose
another sort of supernatural being that you have heard of. When your anima
banner manifests, instead of its usual appearance, it gives the outward
appearance of being that sort of supernatural being. Your charms disguise
themselves as characteristic powers of whatever being you're impersonating. Some
cosmetic decorations of a rare and precious substance appear on your person.
#### The Corpse [ ]
Your Stamina, Manipulation, and Empathy increase to 3, and your Security and
Art increase to 2. If you play dead, you will always fool anyone with such
thoroughness that they feel no need to test, even if you've already fooled them
recently. A butterfly emblem of some variety appears on your person.
#### The Crow [ ]
Your Manipulation, Intimidation, and Subterfuge increase to 3, and your Wits,
Melee, and Security increase to 2. Once per scene, you may reflexively change
your Nature, either back to its original value or to any callous Nature that
cares only about itself. Black feathers appear on your person.

## Charms
### Excellence of the Forgotten Wound (Auspicious) I
At any time, you may reflexively spend 1 essence to lower the difficulty of all
actions using a single caste ability (chosen on activation) by 3, to a minimum
of 3, for Essence + 1 rounds of combat or minutes of noncombat. Alternatively,
you may add your Essence in dice to such rolls for the same duration. At the
cost of 1 essence and 1 willpower, you gain both benefits.
### World-Bending Triumph I
All actions taken against or in opposition to you while in the presence of fear
have their difficulty increased by 1.
### Absolute Denial Defense III
Reflexively spend 1 essence and roll Perception + Occult against difficulty 8.
On a success, you avoid any single damaging, deleterious, or unwanted effect
that you are aware of. Continuous threats only require a single roll.
### Peremptory Object Reassignment III
Reflexively spend 1 essence to transform an object you are holding into a
different mundane, nonmagical object of similar size that you have previously
held before. It returns to its true form at the end of the scene.
### World-Rejecting Stride IV
Spend 1 essence and roll Wits+Investigation against a local Shroud, Gauntlet, or
Banality rating to teleport into an otherworld of your choice. By increasing the
difficulty by 1 and spending an extra essence per ally, you may bring allies
with you. This can also be used in reverse to return. If you stand in the
presence of something which reminds you of your prior unreality, this instead
transports you to the Cataract, regardless of where you meant to go. Bringing
allies to the Cataract requires no additional difficulty or essence.
This charm also permanently grants you the ability to understand the language of
spirits and make yourself clearly understood by them.
### Dream of Rain/Shadow of the Gun II
You may reflexively spend 1 white essence to make all attempts to shoot you with
a firearm increase their difficulty by 3 for the rest of the scene.
You may use your action during combat to point at a target, spend 1 black
essence, and make a Dexterity+Firearms attack at difficulty 6. As soon as the
essence is spent, there's a massive roar and muzzle flash at your fingertip
almost as big as you. This attack inflicts a base of 12 lethal damage.
### Stoic Spider Spy/Sinister Messenger Arachnid II
You may roll Perception+Investigation against difficulty 8, or spend 1 white
essence to automatically succeed, to send a spider of pure essence along threads
of fate to find some fact you desire, so long as that information is neither
lost nor actively hidden. The spider whispers the answer in your ear five
seconds later.
You may roll Intelligence+Expression against difficulty 8, or spend 1 black
essence to automatically succeed, to send a spider of pure essence along threads
of fate to deliver a message to any recipient whose location is a matter of
public knowledge. The spider whispers your message in their ear five seconds
later.
### Identity Confiscation Approach III
Upon making physical contact with the target, spend 1 white essence and roll
Wits+Subterfuge against difficulty 7. Success allows you to steal the target's
identity for one day per success. This allows you to adopt their appearance down
to fingerprints, mimic their voice, and produce (but not actually have) any
requested proof of identity. You can draw upon any social backgrounds they may
have. While this charm is in effect, nobody and nothing will recognize the
target as being the person they claim to be.
### Memories Like Windblown Leaves I
Reflexively spend 1 black essence and roll Intelligence+Subterfuge against the
Willpower rating of a target within arm's reach. On a success, you may steal
their memories of the last hour for one day per success, or may permanently
destroy the memories by paying a point of willpower.
### Suffering Evaluation Eye I
Reflexively spend 1 black essence to learn which of an array of options will
lead to the worst short-term outcome.
### Eloquence in Absence Technique/Unwitting Assassin Nomination III
Spend 1 essence and make a roll - white essence for Expression, Leadership, or
Intimidation, or black essence for Brawl or Melee - and choose a target and
contingency. When the target next satisfies the contingency, their words and
deeds convey the effect of the roll (If a Brawl or Melee roll, use your own
Strength for the resultant damage roll).

## Secret Arts
### Kaleidoscopic Border I - Birth of the Perfect Ego Juggernaut Form
Spend 1 essence to activate this for the rest of the scene. Add your Essence
Rating (3) to all Willpower & Attribute+Ability pools, up to a maximum of 10
dice. Additionally, all Mind and Life sphere effects cast on you increase their
difficulty and Paradox generated by your Essence Rating (3). This is a Form-type
secret art, and may not be active with another Form-type.
### Kaleidoscopic Border II - Two Score Mirror Glance Form
Spend 1 essence to activate this for the rest of the scene. You may move through
any obstacles between yourself and your opponent as if they were not there,
without suffering any difficulty or injury. Fire, mud, brambles, solid walls,
even gravity are all ignorable so long as you are in the pursuit of a foe.
Additionally, all Time and Correspondence sphere effects cast on you increase
their difficulty and paradox generated by your Essence Rating (3). This is a
Form-type secret art, and may not be active with another Form-type.
### Kaleidoscopic Border III - Without Assumption Form
Spend 1 essence to activate this for the rest of the scene. Your bare hands
inflict lethal damage, and you raise your soak by +3. Any supernatural power
which targets a living or animate being cannot be used to target you, as you are
not considered to be either of those things, nor an object. Additionally, all
Entropy and Matter sphere effects cast on you increase their difficulty and
paradox generated by your Essence Rating (3). This is a Form-type secret art,
and may not be active with another Form-type.
