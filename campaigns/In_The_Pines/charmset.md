Shortlist:
- Simple:
  - Life-Amending Reconsideration I (Spend WP to reroll Empathy, Etiquette, Expression, Leadership, Performance)
  - Systematic Understanding of Nothing I (GM gives a useful temporary specialty each morning)
  - Unnatural Recognition Sense III (Turn on basically WFRP second sight for a scene)
  - Perusing the Apocalypse Record V (Once per month, meditate to Learn Things about some monster or group of monsters)
  - Twin-Souled War Ghost V (For the rest of the scene, all attacks you make hit two targets)

- Dual:
  - Burning the Tapestry II (For scene, add Essence rating to either (feat of strength, dodge) or (damage, soak) rolls)
  - I'm Not Here / Hole In History Escape II (Within first 2-3 rounds of combat or first minute of social, relocate to Somewhere Else (either plausible location, editing memories to fit, or 'anywhere safer than here' (which doesn't have to be *safe*) without changing memories))
  - Visions of Other Skies III (Change weather to either be calm and temperate, unreasonably hot or cold, or violent storms or blizzards)
  - Every Man's Friend / Every Man's Foe IV (Make yourself appear as viewers' most trusted or most feared person; different per viewer)

- White:
  - Fortuitous Getaway Opportunity I (Nearby vehicle is ready for you to commandeer it)
  - Weary Wanderer Attitude II (You look so pitiable people will let you in thru any door (but might change their mind once you enter, if they have reason to dislike you or bar you entry))
  - Natural Selection Glance III (Make a particular type of combat action, your choice, harder to perform against you)

- Black:
  - Destiny-Fouling Gesture I (Disrupt any destiny-manipulating/Entropy-sphered/Patterns-evoking supernatural effect)
