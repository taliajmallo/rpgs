# Deepwinter 3rd, 8:10 Awakening

Dear Diary,

   I've been having strange dreams the last couple days. The moon keeps calling
me her daughter and trying to hold me and sing to me, but I can never remember
the song when I wake up. Father got upset when I mentioned them to him, but
wouldn't say why - I think it's related to my mother. Maybe he thinks she'll
come and take me away from him? The only thing he ever mentioned about her is
that she knows magic, so maybe she's a witch from Her Union? But if she is a
witch, why hasn't she tried to find me or contact me before?

   (Also, it's strange she's calling me her *daughter*, but I... think I like it?
It feels... nice, in a way I can't put into words.)
