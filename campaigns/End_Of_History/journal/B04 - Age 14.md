# Bloomingtide 20th, 8:13 Awakening

Dear Diary,

   I tried to make it to Belameer. Father is away again, so I thought I could
leave and find *anywhere* else to live, but I couldnt even make it a mile before
collapsing, and had to crawl back home. I *hate* this. I hate father, I hate
this house, I hate being so sickly and weak! I need to get healthier so I can
survive on my own - he'll definitely kick me out in five years once I reach my
second decade of age and he's no longer pact-bound to provide for me, and if
this week is any indicator, I'm not ready, but that seems like such an
insurmountable goal I don't know where to start...

   The moon in my dreams has been teaching me things - I'm pretty sure she
*isn't* my mother, because I don't think a hag would teach me how to make
bandages out of moonlight, or how to heal wounds with magic? The moon is *nice*.
I like her better than I'd probably like my real mother, and definitely better
than father. I think she's maybe a goddess of my father's people, before he left
everyone he knew behind to be a hermit in the woods - a couple of books mention
that some villages of Her Union favor a moon-goddess, and father came from there
(or so he said when he was drunk, once)? I hope I'll someday be able to travel
to our homeland and meet with her other priestesses...
