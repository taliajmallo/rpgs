# Melting 7th, 8:17 Awakening

Dear Diary,

   My health is getting worse. Father's even stopped giving me chores, in case
the extra rest will help me recover - goddess forbid I perish before my
twentieth and break his pact, that bastard. Nothing the moon teaches me helps -
she can soothe my discomfort, but I'm *still not getting better*. I don't think
I've ever felt so helpless.

   On the bright side, we've had a visitor recently! Father usually keeps his
associates away from the house, but apparently this one *specifically* wanted to
speak to me after he mentioned his "daughter who hears the moon in her dreams!"
Sinta is an inquisitor all the way from the sunlight archipelago, who traveled
northwards to find out more about the moonlit faith and whether it's a
sister-faith to the sunlit faith or a heretical movement or just entirely
unrelated, and apparently my dreams are an interesting enough subject to go out
of her way to talk to me? I don't think father likes her, but she's paying him
for my time, and paying *me* with stories of the outside world - she's only
barely older than me, and has traveled and seen *so much*! I wish I could go
with her when she leaves for back home...
