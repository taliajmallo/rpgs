# Deepwinter 5th, 8:10 Awakening

Dear Diary,

   Father told me the truth. He wanted to learn magic so he made a deal with a
hag, to "protect and raise me for two decades" in exchange. He never cared about
me! I'm not even a tool to him, just some... *obligation*! And it's even worse -
if the moon in my dreams *is* my mother, she just wants to turn me into a hag
like her! And because we live in a hut in the woods, these two are all I have -
I don't have anyone to actually care about me!

   (At least he took my confession that I'd rather be his daughter than his son
well - I guess that's *an* upside to him not giving two shits about me. From now
on, my name is Sakari - and it feels so wonderful to write that out!)
