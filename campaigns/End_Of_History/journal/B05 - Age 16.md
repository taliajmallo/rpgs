# Harvestmere 8th, 8:14 Awakening

Dear Diary,

   I think Father is afraid of me. I know he resents me - why *yes*, father,
raising a daughter is actually a significant effort, mother *definitely* got the
better end of that deal, idiot - but it looks like he only just noticed how much
magic the goddess taught me after he stopped doing so himself, and he still
thinks  she's actually a hag. I... still don't like him - he's stopped trying to
be nice ever since he told me the truth, and just tries to keep me out of the
way, by bribing me with books or giving me chores - but... I don't like him
being afraid of me? I don't want to be scary! The moon's taught me protection
and healing and how to bind wounds - nothing dangerous! I'm not a monster like
mother, and I'm not a warlock like him! I don't *know how* to hurt people with
my magic!

   (I also think the goddess is teaching me knowledge that I'm forgetting I
learned on awakening - I brought up a piece of trivia about Her Union in an
argument with father, and couldn't find it in any of our books afterwards - I
*know* it's true, but can't figure out how I'd know it if not that?)
