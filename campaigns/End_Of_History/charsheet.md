### Skill & General Feats
#### Battle Medicine (Background)
[General] [Healing] [Manipulate] [Skill] [>]
You can patch up yourself or an adjacent ally, even in combat. Attempt a
Medicine check with the same DC as for Treat Wounds, and restore a corresponding
amount of Hit Points; this does not remove the wounded condition. As with Treat
Wounds, you can attempt checks against higher DCs if you have the minimum
proficiency rank. The target is then temporarily immune to your Battle Medicine
for 1 day.

## Ancestry - Kitsune Changeling
### Kitsune
Your size is medium, and you have low-light vision. You can see in dim light as
if it were bright light. Your movement speed is 25 feet.
#### Change Shape
[Concentrate] [Polymorph] [Primal] [Transmutation] [>]
You transform into a fox, which has the statistics of a 1st-level Pest Form, or
back into your true form.

### Changeling
You can see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can see in bright
light, though your vision in darkness is in black and white.

### Ancestry Feats
#### Moon May (1st)
Your mother was a moon hag, a handmaiden of Groetus, and you have a single
scarlet eye and a sliver of her supernal foresight. You can cast guidance as an
occult innate cantrip.

## Background - Soul-Scarred
~~Reflavored Tech-Reliant~~
Some event, be it an accident, attack, or disaster, has left you horribly
scarred by magic. Your body no longer tolerates magical healing in any capacity.
You're trained in the Crafting skill and the Medicine skill. You gain the 
Battle Medicine skill feat, and a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws 
against spells. Healing spells, healing magic items, and magical effects with 
the healing trait have no effect on you.

## Class - Psychic
- Subconscious Mind: Gathered Lore
- Conscious Mind: Tangible Dream

### Psychic Spellcasting
You access the vast well of power that resides within your own mind, calling
forth psychic magic with nothing but thought and will. You can cast occult
spells using the Cast a Spell activity. You alter some of the standard spell
components when casting spells you know from your psychic spellcasting. Instead
of speaking, you substitute any verbal components with a special mental
component determined by your subconscious mind class feature. This represents
how you exert your mind toward your intended effect. Any of these components
impart the concentrate trait to the spell you're casting. You also substitute
any material components with somatic components, though these tend to be simple
movements of the hand or head compared to those used by other spellcasters. Your
spells still have clear and noticeable visual and auditory manifestations, as
normal for a spellcaster.

You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain
Focus Points by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to explore your
mind, whether via meditation, practicing a craft or activity that gives you the
mental space to self-reflect, or talking through your thoughts and feelings with
yourself or another. If you've spent Focus Points only to amp psi cantrips or
fuel psychic abilities since the last time you Refocused, you regain 2 Focus
Points when you Refocus, up to your maximum of 2. If you've spent Focus Points
on focus spells or abilities other than those from the psychic class (for
instance, to cast a focus spell you gained from an archetype), you regain only 1
Focus Point.

### Unleash Psyche
[Psychic] [<>]
Trigger: Your turn begins, you cast a spell last turn, you aren't stupefied.
Result: Your psyche is unleashed for 2 rounds or until you fall unconscious,
whichever happens first. You gain a constant visual manifestation of your magic,
gain a status bonus to instantaneous damage spells equal to twice their spell
level, and can take actions that have the [Psyche] trait. You are then stupefied
1 for two rounds, and even if that is removed early cannot unleash your psyche
again during those two rounds.

### Recall the Teachings
[Divination] [Occult] [Psyche] [Psychic] [>]
The heightened power of your psyche lets you recall every lesson you've ever
learned. You search your mind for the right teaching, which at first seems
cryptic but comes into clarity when it's most relevant. Until the start of your
next turn, you count as having prepared to Aid all allies within 30 feet of you.
If you use the Aid reaction to help one of them during that time, you roll an
Occultism check for Aid as you recall a lesson to help them. Most lessons take
the form of short axioms, parables, or sayings, meaning that conveying them to
your ally usually grants your Aid reaction the auditory and linguistic traits.

### Spells
#### Dancing Lights (Cantrip I*)
[Cantrip] [Evocation] [Light] [Verbal] [Somatic] [>>]
*Range* 120 feet
*Duration* sustained
You create up to four floating lights that each shed light like a torch. When
you Sustain the Spell, you can move any number of lights up to 60 feet.

*Amp* Your lights whirl together, dazzlingly and hypnotically. When you amp the
spell, you create a flashing display comprised of all four lights in an
unoccupied 5-foot square. If you move the lights when you Sustain the Spell, the
lights must remain together. The spell gains the [Visual] trait. Each creature
in a 5-foot emanation around the lights when you Cast the Spell must attempt a
Fortitude save.
- *Success* The creature is dazzled until the start of your next turn and then becomes temporarily immune for 1 minute.
- *Failure* The creature is dazzled until the start of your next turn and must attempt a new save against the spell whenever it starts its turn adjacent to the lights.
- *Critical Failure* As failure, but the creature is also fascinated by the lights until the start of your next turn.

#### Shield (Cantrip I*)
[Abjuration] [Cantrip] [Force] [Verbal] [>]
*Duration* until the start of your next turn
You raise a magical shield of force. This counts as using the Raise a Shield
action, giving you a +1 circumstance bonus to AC until the start of your next
turn, but it doesn't require a hand to use. You may choose to grant this benefit
to a target ally within 30 feet instead of yourself.

While the spell is in effect, you can use the Shield Block reaction with your
magic shield. The shield has Hardness 5. After you use Shield Block, the spell
ends and you can't cast it again for 10 minutes. Unlike a normal Shield Block,
you can use the spell's reaction against the magic missile spell.

Heightening the spell increases the shield's Hardness.
*Heightened (3rd)* The shield has Hardness 10.
*Heightened (5th)* The shield has Hardness 15.
*Heightened (7th)* The shield has Hardness 20.
*Heightened (9th)* The shield has Hardness 25.

*Amp* You create a layered barrier of three shields to improve your defenses.
The duration increases to sustained up to 1 minute. The shield still lowers at
the start of each of your turns, but you can raise it again when you Sustain the
Spell. When you Shield Block with this spell, one of the three layers breaks and
you cease to gain the bonus to AC, but the spell doesn't end. You can keep using
the spell until the final layer breaks; once it does, the spell ends and you
can't cast shield or amped shield again for 10 minutes. You can choose to break
additional layers when you Shield Block with this spell to improve your defenses.
If you break two layers instead of one, increase the Hardness to 1-1/2 × the
normal amount. If you break all three layers, increase the Hardness to double
the normal amount.

#### Imaginary Weapon (Cantrip I*)
[Attack] [Cantrip] [Evocation] [Force] [Psychic] [Verbal] [Somatic] [>>]
*Range* touch; Targets 1 creature
You create a simple weapon of force. Make a melee spell attack roll against your
target's AC. If you hit, you deal your choice of bludgeoning or slashing damage
equal to 1d8 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. On a critical success, you
deal double damage and can choose to detonate your weapon to push the target 10
feet away from you.
*Heightened (+1)* The damage increases by 1d8.
*Amp* You form multiple force weapons to lash out at multiple foes. You make two
imaginary weapon Strikes, each against a different target for 1d8 plus your
spellcasting ability modifier. Your multiple attack penalty doesn't increase
until you've made both Strikes.
*Amp Heightened (+1)* The damage increases by 2d8 instead of 1d8.

#### Guidance (Cantrip I)
[Cantrip] [Divination] [Verbal] [>]
*Range* 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration until the start of your next turn
You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack
roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before
the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before
rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is
then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

#### Moonlit Bandages (Cantrip I)
[Cantrip] [Evocation] [Force] [Somatic] [>]
You spin bandages out of moonlight, for use in tending wounds. This can be used
in lieu of healer's tools for Medicine checks to Administer First Aid or Treat
Wounds. If you have the Battle Medicine feat, you may use that feat as part of
the action of casting this cantrip.

#### Forbidding Ward (Cantrip I*)
[Abjuration] [Cantrip] [Somatic] [Verbal] [>]
*Range* 30 feet; Targets 1 ally and 1 enemy
Duration sustained up to 1 minute
You ward an ally against the attacks and hostile spells from the target enemy.
The target ally gains a +1 status bonus to Armor Class and saving throws against
the target enemy's attacks, spells, and other effects.
*Heightened (6th)* The status bonus increases to +2.

#### Prestidigitation (Cantrip I)
[Cantrip] [Evocation] [Verbal] [Somatic] [>>]
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
Duration sustained
The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for
as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can
choose one of four options. Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse
conditions.
- Cook: Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
- Lift: Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
- Make: Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile - it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
- Tidy: Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1 minute per Bulk.

#### Color Spray (Spell I)
[Illusion] [Incapacitation] [Visual] [Verbal] [Somatic] [>>]
*Area* 15-foot cone
*Saving Throw* Will; *Duration* 1 or more rounds (see below)
Swirling colors affect viewers based on their Will saves.
- *Critical Success* The creature is unaffected.
- *Success* The creature is dazzled for 1 round.
- *Failure* The creature is stunned 1, blinded for 1 round, and dazzled for 1 minute.
- *Critical Failure* The creature is stunned for 1 round and blinded for 1 minute.

#### Soothe (Spell I*)
[Emotion] [Enchantment] [Healing] [Mental] [Verbal] [Somatic] [>>]
*Range* 30 feet; Targets 1 willing living creature
*Duration* 1 minute
You grace the target's mind, boosting its mental defenses and healing its wounds.
The target regains 1d10+4 Hit Points when you Cast the Spell and gains a +2
status bonus to saves against mental effects for the duration.
*Heightened (+1)* The amount of healing increases by 1d10+4.
