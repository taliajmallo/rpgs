### Skill & General Feats
#### Assurance, Occultism (Background)
[Fortune] [General] [Skill]
Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks. Choose a skill
you're trained in. You can forgo rolling a skill check for that skill to instead
receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses,
penalties, or modifiers).
#### Spun Moonlight (2nd Skill)
[Archetype] [Skill] [General]
**Prerequisites** Trained in Occult, trained in Craft
You may spin moonlight into threads, allowing you to use Occult instead of Craft
when creating, repairing, or working with item made primarily of fabric. You
must still pay the normal material cost, as any raw fabric you wouldn't need to
purchase is replaced with an equivalent cost in reagents.
#### Imbued Moonlight (3rd General)
[Archetype] [Skill] [General]
**Prerequisites** Spun Moonlight, expert in Occultism
The moonlight you spin into threads may be imbued with magical effects. You may
craft magical items as if you had the Magical Crafting skill feat, using
Occultism instead of Craft. When you select this feat, you gain formulas for
four common magic items of 2nd level or lower.

## Automatic Bonus Progression
- Attack Potency I
- Skill Potency I

## Ancestry - Kitsune Changeling
### Kitsune
Your size is medium, and you have low-light vision. You can see in dim light as
if it were bright light. Your movement speed is 25 feet.
#### Change Shape
[Concentrate] [Polymorph] [Primal] [Transmutation] [>]
You transform into a fox, which has the statistics of a 1st-level Pest Form, or
back into your true form.

### Changeling
You can see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can see in bright
light, though your vision in darkness is in black and white.

### Ancestry Feats
#### Moon May (1st)
Your mother was a moon hag, a handmaiden of Groetus, and you have a single
scarlet eye and a sliver of her supernal foresight. You can cast guidance as an
occult innate cantrip.
##### Guidance (Cantrip II Innate)
[Cantrip] [Divination] [Verbal] [>]
*Range* 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration until the start of your next turn
You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack
roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before
the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before
rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is
then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

### Hagtouched Calling
### Tier One Boon: Mist Child
You blend in with unnatural subtlety. When you are concealed or hidden, increase
the DC of the flat check to target you to 6 if you're concealed or 12 if you're
hidden.
### Tier One Bane: Hagmarked
You've unknowingly taken the first step towards becoming a hag.

## Background - Raised by Belief
Whether in a monastery, a religious household, or just as part of your everyday
life, your upbringing was steeped in the traditions of a faith or philosophy.
You might remain committed or you may have turned from your childhood creed, but
your skills are still founded in your devotion.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to an ability specified in the
Divine Ability entry for your deity, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in your deity's associated skill, and you gain Assurance with
that skill. You gain a Lore skill with a subcategory associated with your deity.
### Languages
Patter-Whistle, Low Song, High Song, Vaaltid

## Class - Lunar Kineticist
### Class Benefits

#### Gather An Element
[Conjuration] [Kineticist] [Manipulate] [Occult] [>]
Gather moonlight about you or in your palm.

#### Elemental Blast
[Evocation] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Negative] [Occult] [>]
Make a melee or ranged strike using your gathered moonlight. This is considered
to be an unarmed attack. It deals 1d6 negative damage, and is considered to deal
silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like. If a
melee attack, it has the traits fatal d10, finesse, and negative. If a ranged
attack, it has the traits fatal d10 and negative, with a ranged increment of 60
feet. You may use your Constitution modifier instead of your Strength or
Dexterity modifier for attack rolls.

#### Adapt Element
[Concentrate] [Evocation] [Kineticist] [Manipulate] [Occult] [>>]
You can do small utility effects with moonlight.

#### Extract Element
[Kineticist] [Manipulate] [Occult] [Transmutation] [>]
Choose a creature with 30 feet that is undead, has the Negative trait, or
otherwise has a negative energy elemental nature. That creature must attempt a
Fortitude save against your class DC or take 2d4 damage as you steal the
elemental essence from its body, as well as the following effects.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage, you Gather An Element, and the
creature is weakened against your impulses. It takes a -1 circumstance penalty
to AC and saves while you have the element gathered. You may ignore any
resistance it has entirely, and if it has immunity it instead has resistance
equal to its level.
**Failure** As success, but the creature takes full damage.
**Critical Failure** As failure, but the creature takes double damage.
**Level (+3)** The damage increases by 1d4.

### Class Feats
#### Lunar Condemnation (Dedicated Gate)
[Conjuration] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Negative] [Occult] [Overflow] [>>]
Gesturing with each hand, pull moonlight down from the heavens onto your foes.
Either choose different two 5-foot squares, or a single 5-foot burst, each of
which must be within 30 feet of you. Enemies within those spaces, or up to 30
feet directly above them, take 1d6 negative damage with a Fortitude save against
your class DC.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected.
**Success** The creature takes half damage.
**Failure** The creature takes full damage, and is your choice of Enfeebled 1 or Clumsy 1.
**Critical Failure** The creature takes double damage, and is both Enfeebled 1 and Clumsy 1.
**Level (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.

#### Nurturing Blood (Dedicated Gate)
[Healing] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Necromancy] [Occult] [<]
**Trigger** An ally within 60 feet deals persistent bleed damage or reduces a creature to 0 hit points.
Gentle moonlight invigorates your ally, renewing their strength with the tithe
of blood paid. The target ally gains temporary hit points equal to 2 + half your
level that last until the end of your next turn. You may instead choose to heal
them for 3 hit points per level you have, but they then become temporarily
immune to this impulse for ten minutes.

#### Waxing Lunacy (Dedicated Gate)
[Enchantment] [Impulse] [Kinetic_Aura] [Kineticist] [Mental] [Occult] [>>]
Lunar madness begins to tinge the minds of those around you. Any creature that
enters the aura or ends its turn there must make a Will save against your class
DC. On a failure, they become Stupefied 1 for one round. On a critical failure,
they also become Fascinated for one round with a creature of your choice that is
within 30 feet of them.

#### Celestial Whispers (Dedicated Gate)
[Divination] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Occult] [>]
The moonlight in your hand gives you both light and sight. Recall Knowledge
about a creature, object, or location that is illuminated by moonlight. You may
use Occultism in place of the most appropriate skill.

#### Lunar Kineticist Dedication (2nd Class)
[Uncommon] [Archetype] [Class] [Dedication]
When you cause a creature to gain the Fascinated condition, you may give them
the Obsessed condition instead. Obsessed is identical to Fascinated, except that
instead of being removed instantly if a hostile action is used against the
creature or its allies, the condition is removed if the creature takes an action
targeting the subject of its fascination.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two
other feats from the Lunar Kineticist archetype.

### Free Archetype
#### Curse Maelstrom Dedication (2nd Archetype)
You can manifest a curse maelstrom state in the following ways:
- You succeed on a check, and accept the GM's offer to reroll
- A foe forces you to roll with a misfortune effect
- You fail a saving throw against a foe's curse effect

While in a curse maelstrom state, you cannot benefit from fortune effects in any
way, and all creatures other than you within a 10-foot emanation take a -1
status penalty to all saving throws and skill checks. You gain the Expel
Maelstrom action while in this state.
##### Expel Maelstrom
[Curse] [Necromancy] [Occult] [>]
Choose one creature within 60 feet to make a Will save against your class DC,
and your curse maelstrom state ends.
**Critical Success** The creature is unaffected, and the curse's energy
dissipates harmlessly.
**Success** The creature comes to house the maelstrom's wrath within it. It
takes a -1 status penalty to all saving throws and skill checks for 1 minute.
**Failure** The maelstrom strikes deep into the creature's soul. It takes a -2
status penalty to all saving throws and skill checks for 10 minutes.
**Critical Failure** The maelstrom pitches the creature into a single fit of
utter misfortune before burrowing into its soul. As failure, but the creature
also must roll twice and take the lower result on its next saving throw or skill
check; this is a misfortune effect.
