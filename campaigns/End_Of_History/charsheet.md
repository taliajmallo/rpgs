### Assurance, Occultism (Background)
[Fortune] [General] [Skill]
Even in the worst circumstances, you can perform basic tasks. Choose a skill
you're trained in. You can forgo rolling a skill check for that skill to instead
receive a result of 10 + your proficiency bonus (do not apply any other bonuses,
penalties, or modifiers).

### Spun Moonlight (2nd Skill)
[Rare] [General] [Skill]
**Prerequisites** Trained in Occult, trained in Craft
You may spin moonlight into threads, allowing you to use Occult instead of Craft
when creating, repairing, or working with item made primarily of fabric. You
must still pay the normal material cost, as any raw fabric you wouldn't need to
purchase is replaced with an equivalent cost in reagents.

### Imbued Moonlight (3rd Divine Insight)
[Rare] [General] [Skill]
**Prerequisites** Spun Moonlight, expert in Occultism
The moonlight you spin into threads may be imbued with magical effects. You may
craft magical items as if you had the Magical Crafting skill feat, using
Occultism instead of Craft. When you select this feat, you gain formulas for
four common magic items of 2nd level or lower.

### Prescient Planner (3rd General)
[General]
**Cost** the Price of the chosen item
**Requirements** You haven't used this ability since the last time you were able
to purchase goods.
You regularly create convoluted plans and contingencies, using your resources to
enact them. You take 1 minute to remove your backpack, then carefully remove an
item you hadn't previously declared that you purchasedâ€”you intuited that you
would come to need the item and purchased it at the latest opportunity. The item
must be a piece of adventuring gear, and can't be a weapon, armor, alchemical
item, magic item, or other treasure. It must be common with a level no higher
than half your level, and its Bulk must be low enough that carrying it wouldn't
have made you encumbered.

### Quick Identification (4th Skill)
[General] [Skill]
You only take 1 minute when using Identify Magic to determine the properties of
an item, ongoing effect, or location. If you're a master, it becomes a three
action activity, and if you're legendary, it becomes a 1 action activity.

## Automatic Bonus Progression
- Attack Potency I
- Skill Potency I
- Devastating I

## Ancestry - Kitsune Changeling
### Kitsune
Your size is medium, and you have low-light vision. You can see in dim light as
if it were bright light. Your movement speed is 25 feet.

#### Change Shape
[Concentrate] [Polymorph] [Primal] [Transmutation] [>]
You transform into a fox, which has the statistics of a 1st-level Pest Form, or
back into your true form.

### Changeling
You can see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can see in bright
light, though your vision in darkness is in black and white.

### Ancestry Feats
#### Moon May (1st)
Your mother was a moon hag, and you have a single scarlet eye and a sliver of
her supernal foresight. You can cast guidance as an occult innate cantrip.

##### Guidance (Cantrip II Innate)
[Cantrip] [Divination] [Verbal] [>]
*Range* 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration until the start of your next turn
You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack
roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before
the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before
rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is
then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

### Hagtouched Calling
Your heritage beckons.

#### Tier One Boon: Mist Child
You blend in with unnatural subtlety. When you are concealed or hidden, increase
the DC of the flat check to target you to 6 if you're concealed or 12 if you're
hidden.

#### Tier One Bane: Hagmarked
You've unknowingly taken the first step towards becoming a hag.

## Background - Raised by Belief
Whether in a monastery, a religious household, or just as part of your everyday
life, your upbringing was steeped in the traditions of a faith or philosophy.
You might remain committed or you may have turned from your childhood creed, but
your skills are still founded in your devotion.
Choose two ability boosts. One boost must be to an ability specified in the
Divine Ability entry for your deity, and one is a free ability boost.
You're trained in your deity's associated skill, and you gain Assurance with
that skill. You gain a Lore skill with a subcategory associated with your deity.

### Languages
Patter-Whistle, Low Song, High Song, Vaaltid

## Class - Avenger
The moon-mother watches over you, child.
### Divine Fury (1st Feature)
Your Divine Fury damage type is negative.

### Vow of Enmity (1st Feature)
[Avenger] [Concentrate] [Fortune]
Declare a vow against a creature within 60 feet of you. When you miss a melee
Strike against the chosen creature, if you are isolated, you may reroll the
missed attack roll and keep the result. You are isolated if there are no enemies
adjacent to you except your target, or if you have that status from another
ability. You may only have one creature designated with your Vow of Enmity at a
time, and cannot use the ability again until a minute passes, the target is
reduced to 0 hit points, or the target surrenders to you or your allies.

### Censure of Knowledge (1st Feature)
When you successfully Recall Knowledge on the target of your Vow of Enmity, you
are isolated for 1 round.

### Enmity Knowledge (1st Class)
As part of the action used for Vow of Enmity, you may attempt a check to Recall
Knowledge about the target. If the target relates to your deity's anathema, you
gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check.

### Enmity Bane (2nd Class)
Against humanoids that transgress against your deity's anathema, your Strikes
gain a +2 circumstance bonus to damage. This increases to +4 if you have master
proficiency with the weapon used.

### Mind Smith Dedication (2nd Archetype)
[Archetype] [Dedication]
During your daily preparations, you may envision a mind weapon that you then
become able to manifest with an interact action. You may choose whether it is a
one handed weapon that deals d4 damage with the agile and finesse traits, a one
handed weapon that deals d6 damage with the finesse trait, a one handed weapon
that deals d8 damage, or a two-handed weapon that deals d10 damage with the
reach trait. Furthermore, you may decide whether it deals bludgeoning damage and
belongs to the club weapon group, deals piercing damage and belongs to the spear
weapon group, or deals slashing damage and belongs to the sword weapon group. It
is an extension of your mind, and has no hardness; any damage it would take
instead becomes mental damage to you. Only you can carry, hold, or wield it - it
vanishes if ever removed from your hand.
You may bind a keepsake to it. The keepsake cannot be a magical item, nor may it
have any value beyond runes inscribed on it. You may inscribe runes on it in the
same way as you would a weapon, and those runes apply to your mind weapon. If
the keepsake is ever lost or destroyed, you can spend 1 week of downtime linking
a new keepsake with the mind weapon.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you have gained two
other feats from the sentinel archetype.

### Devoted Speed (3rd Feature)
Gain a +10' status bonus to your speed when you have an Oath of Enmity active;
half benefit otherwise. This increases by 5' at 7th level and every 4 levels
thereafter.

### Vengeful Smite (4th Class)
[Avenger]
Gain the Vengeful Smite covenant spell, and increase your maximum Focus by 1.
#### Vengeful Smite
[Avenger] [Evocation] [Verbal] [<>]
Upon hitting with a strike, you deal 2d4 negative damage.
**Heightened (+1)** The damage increases by 1d4.

### Just the Tool (4th Archetype)
[Archetype] [Concentrate] [>]
You may temporarily change your weapon's shape into a single simple tool to help
with a mundane task, or change it back into its weapon form.

## Belongings
Coinage: 13.75
Bulk 2.4/7

### Magic Items
#### Ring of Minor Arcana
[Uncommon] [Arcane] [Evocation] [Invested]

This rose-gold ring is adorned in the center by a somewhat ominous-looking
horned skull. This ring gives you the power to cast the following innate arcane
cantrips any number of times each day: detect magic, mage hand, and

spellcaster, these can instead be heightened to the level of your cantrips.
