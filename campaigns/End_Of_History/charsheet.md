### Dubious Knowledge (Background)
[General] [Skill]
When you fail (but don't critically fail) a Recall Knowledge check using any
skill, you learn the correct answer and an erroneous answer, but you don't have
any way to differentiate which is which. This can occur as not knowing something
is significant, but not whether it's good or bad.

### Crafter's Appraisal (2nd Skill)
[General] [Skill]
You can use Crafting instead of a skill associated with a magic tradition to
Identify Magic on magic items, though not on any other sorts of magic.

### Magical Crafting (4th Skill)
[General] [Skill]
You can Craft magic items. When you select this feat, you gain formulas for four
common magic items of 2nd level or lower. <TODO>

### Recognize Spell (6th Skill)
[General] [Secret] [Skill] [â†»]
Trigger: A creature within line of sight casts a spell that you don't have
  prepared or in your spell repertoire, or a trap or similar object casts such a
  spell. You must be aware of the casting.
Reaction: You automatically recognize the spell if it is of rank 2 or lower, or
  is occult and rank 4 or lower. Otherwise, the GM makes a secret check using
  the relevant skill. Success identifies it, critical success also grants +1 AC
  against it, and critical failure misidentifies it as a different spell.

## Automatic Bonus Progression
- Attack Potency I
- Skill Potency II
- Devastating I
- Defense Potency I

## Ancestry - Kitsune Changeling
### Kitsune
Your size is medium, and you have low-light vision. You can see in dim light as
if it were bright light. Your movement speed is 25 feet.

#### Change Shape
[Concentrate] [Polymorph] [Primal] [Transmutation] [>]
You transform into a fox, which has the statistics of a 1st-level Pest Form, or
back into your true form.

### Changeling
You can see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can see in bright
light, though your vision in darkness is in black and white.

### Moon May (1st Ancestry)
Your mother was a moon hag, and you have a single scarlet eye and a sliver of
her supernal foresight. You can cast guidance as an occult innate cantrip.

#### Guidance (Cantrip II Innate)
[Cantrip] [Divination] [Verbal] [>]
*Range* 30 feet; Targets 1 creature
Duration until the start of your next turn
You ask for divine guidance, granting the target a +1 status bonus to one attack
roll, Perception check, saving throw, or skill check the target attempts before
the duration ends. The target chooses which roll to use the bonus on before
rolling. If the target uses the bonus, the spell ends. Either way, the target is
then temporarily immune for 1 hour.

### Myriad Forms (5th Ancestry)
You may use Change Shape to take the form of your previous self, with minor
alterations due to your soul-transposed nature.

### Hagtouched Calling
Your heritage beckons.

#### Tier One Boon: Mist Child
You blend in with unnatural subtlety. When you are concealed or hidden, increase
the DC of the flat check to target you to 6 if you're concealed or 12 if you're
hidden.

#### Tier One Bane: Hagmarked
You've unknowingly taken the first step towards becoming a hag.

## Spells
### Incendiary Aura (Focus III)
[Uncommon] [Concentrate] [Fire] [Focus] [Manipulate] [Oracle] [>>]
Area 10' emanation
Duration 1 minute
You surround yourself with a combustible aura. Each time a creature within the
aura takes fire damage, it catches on fire, taking 2d4 persistent fire damage.
Heightened (+2) The persistent damage increases by 1d4 and the radius of the
emanation increases by 5 feet.

### Detect Magic (Cantrip III)

### Prestidigitation (Cantrip III)
[Cantrip] [Evocation] [Verbal] [Somatic] [>>]
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
Duration sustained
The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for
as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can
choose one of four options. Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse
conditions.
- Cook: Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
- Lift: Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the
  ground.
- Make: Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical
  substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile - it
  can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
- Tidy: Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an
  object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1
  minute per Bulk.

### Magic Items
#### Ring of Minor Arcana
[Uncommon] [Arcane] [Evocation] [Invested]
Value 160
This rose-gold ring is adorned in the center by a somewhat ominous-looking
horned skull. This ring gives you the power to cast the following innate arcane
cantrips any number of times each day: detect magic, mage hand, and
prestidigitation. Each is cast as a 1st-level spell. If you are an arcane
spellcaster, these can instead be heightened to the level of your cantrips.
