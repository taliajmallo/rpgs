# Kineticist Class Archetype: Lunar Kineticist
## Blood-Moon Gate (1st)
**Prerequisites**: You must be a Kineticist with a Dedicated Gate.

**Adjustments**: Instead of choosing an elemental plane as normal, your inner gate links you to the domain of the Blood Moon. Replace the Primal trait on all Kineticist feats with the Occult trait. You become Trained in Occultism instead of Nature.

## Blood Moon Element
**Elemental Blast**: The Blood Moon Elemental Blast deals 1d6 negative damage. In melee, it has the traits fatal d10, finesse, and negative. At range, it has the traits fatal d10 and negative, with a range increment of 60 feet. Elemental Blast and all Blood-Moon Impulses deal silver damage for the purposes of weaknesses, resistances, and the like, and you may use your Constitution modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for attack rolls.
**Adapt Element**: You gain the Illuminate option for Adapt Element. You may cause the portion of moonlight to glow as brightly as a torch.
**Extract Element**: Undead are considered to have the negative elemental nature, and may be targeted by Extract Element.
**Critical Element**: The target becomes Stupefied 1 for one round.
**Adapt Terrain**: When proliferating moonlight, you may affix it to a solid object, and instead of dissipating instantly, it remains until the next sunrise.

## Lunar Kineticist Dedication (Feat 2)
[Uncommon] [Archetype] [Class] [Dedication]
When you cause a creature to gain the Fascinated condition, you may give them the Obsessed condition instead. Obsessed is identical to Fascinated, except that instead of being removed instantly if a hostile action is used against the creature or its allies, the condition is removed if the creature takes an action targeting the subject of its fascination.
**Special** You can't select another dedication feat until you've gained two other feats from the Lunar Kineticist archetype.

## Spun Moonlight (Feat 2)

You may spin moonlight into threads, allowing you to use Occult instead of Craft when creating a magic item or an item made primarily of fabric.

## Blind Lunacy (Feat 4)
[Archetype] [Fortune]
You do not count as an appropriate target for Confused creatures to attack, and whenever you are Confused, you have full control over the targets you attack (but must still use all actions to attack a target).

## Moon's Light (Feat 6)
[Archetype] [Divination] [Occult]
The glow of the moon's light reveals secrets to you. While you're exploring but not Searching, the GM rolls a secret check for you to find haunts that usually require Searching, as well as spirits, creatures on the Ethereal Plane, and beings made entirely of spiritual essence, such as celestials, fiends, and monitors.
You can also potentially notice ethereal creatures and spirits inside solid objects, provided they are within 30 feet of you. This applies while Searching, Seeking, and on the automatic secret check from Moon's Light. You can still notice spirits only on a successful check, and you can't see them if they're more than 5 feet inside an object.
When you notice a creature with Moon's Light, you also learn its location, making it hidden to you if it had been undetected.

## Drifting Moonlight (Feat 8)
[Archetype] [Occult] [>]
Pull lunar influence towards yourself and step through a curtain of moonlight. Gather an Element and Step in any order.

## Magic Sense (Feat 12)
[Archetype] [Detection] [Divination] [Occult]
You have a literal sixth sense for ambient magic in your vicinity. You can sense the presence of magic auras as though you were always using a 1st-level detect magic spell. This detects magic in your field of vision only. When you Seek, you gain the benefits of a 3rd-level detect magic spell on things you see (in addition to the normal benefits of Seeking). You can turn this sense off and on with a free action at the start or the end of your turn.

## BEHOLD HER LIGHT BEHOLD BEHOLD (Feat 18)
[Archetype] [Enchantment] [Mental] [Occult] [<]
**Trigger** You roll a success on a Will save against a mental effect from a creature.
You are not alone in your brain, and your would-be attacker sees more than is safe for their fragile psyche. The triggering creature is Confused for one round.
