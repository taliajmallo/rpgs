Party Role: Mechanic & Medical
- Bit one: legacy
  - What life was I pulled from? I was a waitress in a saloon, aspired to be a cook instead but waitressing pays the bills.
  - Went from making biscuits and gravy to fixin' up life support units.
     - I have to make everything with "cooking" thoughts, else it ain't gonna sit right in my brain.
  - This life's shit, clear as day, but ain't like I can go back, can I? The whole damn world just *ended*.
- Bit 2: bond
  - Apocalyptic preacher, fire-and-brimstone cult leader
  - Has a flock of androids, had to deconstruct one or two
  - I am also a useless lesbian for her (even if I also am scared shitless of her)
- Bit 3: catalyst
  - A friend is lost: my closest friend was taken and scrapped for parts in the dead of night
  - She worked as a stablehand, all strong and impressive.
  - Who was she most dear to? Me, duh.
  - Why was she lost? Because she sinned - a false prophet.
  - Who feels her absence most harshly? Also me!
  - Are there those glad to be rid of her? Yup, cult leader, another girl who had a crush on me but I'm programmed to reject her suit
  - Those left behind and wanting answers - I still don't know if I know the truth, but knew enough to get the hell out.

I stole the cult leader's horse - it's an old, but well-maintained horse. ^.^



The day the whole world just up an' broke, I was 'bout halfway thru a batch o'
gravy when the first sandstorm swept in. The saloon was nice an' empty, too
early in the day for any real drinkin' and too late for anyone to be in for
breakfast. Ol' Holt had just stepped outside to smoke, since I always gave 'im
grief if he got my kitchen smellin' like his shit tobacco, an' I just saw as he...
ain't no other word for it than just *disintegrated* as the sand just cut thru
'im at what must'a been a hundred-some miles an hour. I made it to the cellar
'fore I got more'n'a couple scratches, an' sheltered there a while - only God
knows how long - 'til the noise cut.

When I went back up an' out to look at the damage, most o' the town'd been
flattened. Nothin' made of wood was still there proper - some got blown over,
some got holes thru, some just disappeared God-knows-how to God-knows-where. All
that was left was an odd-lookin' metal thing in the center o' where town hall
used to be, an' right outside it, a mean-lookin' woman in odd clothes an' holdin'
her right wrist close, injured-like. Bitch marched right up to me, an' without
as much as an introduction, told me "You are going to do exactly what I tell you,
and if you do, we might not die here."

I didn't believe her at first when she told me that this entire planet was a
resort an' playground, or that I ain't human - but as she took me into the deep
o' that bunker, I saw too much to think otherwise. Since her hand was cut to
ribbons, all her technical know-how an' all her precious user's manuals were
worthless without a second hand to fix things with, so she had me get deep in
the guts o' all the machines there to keep the life support on, an' I saw the
kinds o' stuff I'd'a thought only exists in tall tales. Not to mention, bitch
had to do something to my head 'fore I could actually make heads nor tails o'
the machines - even now, I ain't able to work with anything more fancy 'n a
steam engine 'less I trick my brain into thinkin' of it as some kind o' food.
