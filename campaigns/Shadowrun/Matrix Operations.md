# Matrix Operations for the Non-Decker

## The Wireless World
Outside of secure facilities, wired connections are a thing of the past. The matrix is an ever-shifting network of peer-to-peer connections between wireless devices, spanning the entire globe.

Because of this, distance does not *really* exist in the matrix. Helpful algorithms show you what they think you might be interested in, and hide the things you wouldn't be. Mechanically, this means you can automatically spot any icon within 100m that has a wireless presence; anything else requires effort.

### Things in the Matrix
Everything in the matrix is an icon. Icons are virtual representations of things, usually in a way that shows you what the thing is and how to use it (with rare exceptions). A data file's icon might be a piece of paper, or possibly a datapad if it has protections. A gun's icon is, well, probably going to be a gun. You can change the icon of anything you own, so long as it effectively communicates what the thing is - no disguising your gun as a music file without a cyberdeck of your own.

As a non-decker, the things to be aware of in the matrix are Personas and Devices. Personas are people using a commlink or cyberdeck (the device becomes part of the persona when in use). Since you are legally required to broadcast your (fake) SIN, you will usually have your own persona, even if you refuse to touch the rest of the matrix. Devices are anything that has a meatspace counterpart and is not a persona - your smartgun, the lock on your front door, your biomonitor.

### PANs
If you have a good commlink or cyberdeck, it will be much less hackable than anything else you own. Thankfully, there's a way to turn this into protection for the rest of your belongings - a personal area network. You (or a friendly decker with good Matrix stealth and defense) can make a commlink or cyberdeck into the master device of a PAN, and slave up to (master's Device Rating x 3) other devices to it. If you do so, slaved devices can use their master's ratings for defenses. The only risk is that if someone physically plugs into a slave device, they can use it as a backdoor into the master device. Note that you cannot slave your commlink to another while you are using it, as personas cannot be slaves in a PAN.

Ari's deck has a Device Rating of 6, so she can protect a total of 18 devices, one of which will always be her drone - the rest can be used for high-value teammate gear.

### Wireless Presence
Devices and personas can have one of three statuses: broadcasting, running silent, and offline. These are per icon - you can have your commlink broadcasting, your smartgun running silent, and your cybereyes offline. Each of these statuses has important use cases in shadowrunning.

#### Broadcasting
Broadcasting is for normal online functionality. Your device works as expected, and benefits from any wireless bonuses it may have. Anyone with AR or VR can spot you from 100m away without effort.

- When to use: purchasing groceries, or disguising yourself as an employee.
- When not to use: sneaking past a guardpost at night.

#### Running Silent
When running silent, your device keeps its functionality and wireless benefits, and you do not automatically appear to anyone using AR/VR! However, there are some downsides.

First, all matrix actions (including matrix defense rolls) suffer a -2 die pool penalty. This is usually a moot point for non-deckers, but does make devices more vulnerable to bricking if they are spotted.

Second, icons running silent are very conspicuous to anyone who is looking for them. Anyone with middling Computer can take an action to check whether there is an icon running silent within 100m. Once they know that, can start making skill checks to spot a random icon matching any criteria they provide (e.g. "is not a stealth tag" or "is an Ares rifle belonging to a troll physically located at these GPS coordinates"). Icons in Ari's PAN will be rather sneaky; any icon of yours outside that will be very not-sneaky.

- When to use: after an alarm has already gone off, or against a group without a decker.
- When not to use: infiltrating an office building during business hours.

#### Offline
Offline means you no longer gain any wireless benefits, but renders you unhackable. You can't legally turn your commlink off when out in public, but you can still turn other things off, or turn your commlink off during a mission (though this deprives Ari of the ability to highlight targets and threats for you, so maybe don't turn that off).

- When to use: an enemy hacker has marks on your device, or you don't need its wireless benefit.
- When not to use: on a device whose wireless functionality is important.
