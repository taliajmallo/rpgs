## Stats

## Moonshadow Caste Properties
### Abyssal Envoy
The Moonshadow has diplomatic immunity when treating with spirits, the Fair Folk
and the denizens of Hell. So long as the Moonshadow approaches them on
legitimate business of some kind, such creatures may not attack her or her
companions without just cause, and such creatures must observe the local rules
of hospitality. Such beings may still attempt to provoke members of the
Abyssal's embassy into breaking the peace, thus voiding this effect's protection.
### Sanctify Oath
For 10 motes, one Willpower, the Moonshadow sanctifies an oath she has
witnessed. The Exalt touches the oathgivers (or their words, as they pass
through the air), her caste mark flashing imperceptibly. If she wishes, her
anima briefly flares, swirling with the dark runes that glow with an
unmistakable fell power.
Oath-givers who break pacts sanctified by the Moonshadow (including the Exalt
herself) are subject to a terrible curse. The details of the curse are devised
by the Storyteller, ideally reflecting the oath broken and always involving some
kind of sadistic torment. A character who dies with his end of a bargain
unfulfilled will always linger as a ghost, still bound to his word, and cannot
pass through lethe until he is released from the oath.
### Stairwell of Darkness
For 10 motes, one Willpower, the Moonshadow can open a dark staircase in the
ground before her leading down into the Underworld, which vanishes at the end of
her next turn. After walking down it she will appear in the heart of the
nearest shadowland at midnight that night, though no time has passed from her
perspective. Other characters may follow her down the staircase before it
closes, but until the Moonshadow herself has walked through into the Underworld
no others are able to.
If this power is used in the Underworld, the Moonshadow instead creates a
staircase leading up and arrives in the nearest shadowland at midday. It cannot
be used while already inside a shadowland.
### Abyssal Experience
Turning two or more parties against each other; gaining a noteworthy advantage
for the character or the Circle through diplomatic means; successfully
navigating and thwarting social or geographical obstacles preventing the
character or Circle from achieving a significant goal; exploiting a cultural
tradition or legal system in furtherance of a Major or Defining Intimacy;
bringing someone's Intimacies closer to aligning with those of the Moonshadow or
with the goals of his Circle; dismantling a social institution or transforming
one in a way that aids the character's or Circle's agendas.

## Charms
### Bureaucracy
#### Alluring Eloquence Method
- Cost: 1m; Mins: Bureaucracy 1, Essence 1
- Type: Supplemental
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- The smooth tongue of the Abyssal can make any deal sound appealing. She makes a bargain action using (Charisma or Manipulation + Bureaucracy), which gains (Essence or 3, whichever is higher) bonus dice.
#### The Villain You Know
- Cost: 2m; Mins: Bureaucracy 3, Essence 1
- Type: Supplemental
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Alluring Eloquence Method
- The Abyssal's offer doesn't have to be good for others to accept it. It only needs to be better than the alternatives. This Charm enhances a persuade or bargain action made with any Ability, allowing the Abyssal to leverage negative Intimacies towards her contextual rivals as though they were positive Intimacies towards herself. For example, when a desperate man is presented with the option of selling a prized heirloom to a merchant he despises so he can afford food, the Abyssal could use that hatred to convince him to make a deal with her.
- This Charm does not require that the Abyssal and the subject of the negative Intimacy be the only two options. In the above example, even if there were a dozen other perfectly trustworthy merchants all making offers, the Abyssal would still be able to use the one hated one to her own advantage. This effect may also allow the Abyssal to effectively use a single Intimacy twice. If she were the only other option, she could persuade the man to sell her the heirloom using the positive Intimacy towards herself, then if he still refused she could use the negative intimacy towards the merchant in a second influence attempt.

### Occult
#### Spirit Sensing Technique
- Cost: 3m; Mins: Occult 1, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: One scene
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- Projecting her senses into the realm of ghosts and other spirits, the Abyssal gains the ability to perceive immaterial beings.
#### Scent of Death
- Cost: -; Mins: Occult 2, Essence 1
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Spirit Sensing Technique
- The senses of the Abyssal are finely tuned to notice her fellows. Whenever any creature of darkness is within the range of her senses, including an immaterial one, some uncanny sense informs her of this fact. This also grants her (half Occult, rounded up) automatic successes to Awareness-based rolls to detect such beings.
#### Queen of the Night
- Cost: -; Mins: Occult 2, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Scent of Death
- The Abyssal Exalted stand as the preeminent princes of darkness, and their lessers must bow to them. Whenever she detects another creature of darkness using Scent of Death, the Abyssal rolls (Charisma + Presence) with (Occult) non-Charm bonus dice to instill a Tie of respect towards herself in that character. Any other creatures of darkness she encounters for the remainder of the scene are affected by the same roll.
#### Shadowlands Circle Necromancy
- Cost: -; Mins: Occult 3, Essence 1
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- Drawing ever closer to oneness with the death, the Abyssal initiates into the Shadowlands Circle of necromancy. She gains one necromantic spell for free as her control spell, which may feature in her anima banner, gains a shaping ritual, and can perform necromantic workings.
#### Terrestrial Circle Sorcery
- Cost: -; Mins: Occult 3, Essence 1
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Any four Occult Charms
- Demonstrating a more unorthodox mystical talent, the Abyssal initiates into the Terrestrial Circle of sorcery. She gains a free spell which functions as her control spell, gains access to sorcerous workings and learns one shaping ritual.

### Presence
#### Soul-Flaying Gaze II
- Cost: -; Mins: Presence 2, Essence 1
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- With this Charm, the Abyssal gains the ability to make attacks using (any social Attribute + Presence). Such attacks use the thrown (short) and lethal tags and use the traits of light mortal weapons. Her withering attacks deal (7 + threshold successes) damage, gaining no bonus damage from her Strength, and subtract the target's Resolve from damage instead of his soak.
- A Presence 5, Essence 2+ repurchase gives the Abyssal's gaze the traits of a light artifact weapon, increasing its damage to (10 + threshold successes).
#### Elegant Tyrant's Majesty
- Cost: 5m or 7m; Mins: Presence 2, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: One scene
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- The Abyssal is effortlessly eloquent, allowing her to easily sway the minds of the living. She gains three dice on social influence rolls made with any Ability, and all other Charms she use to enhance or create social influence actions benefit from a one mote discount, to a minimum of one mote.
- Elegant Tyrant's Majesty can be activated for seven motes rather than five. Doing so increases its duration to indefinite.
#### Death's Alluring Face
- Cost: 2m; Mins: Presence 3, Essence 1
- Type: Supplemental
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- The Abyssal's eerie beauty gives her double 9s on seduction-based influence using any Attribute, or any other social influence using Appearance. If she gains any bonus dice due to high Appearance, she gains an additional such die as a non-Charm bonus.
- If the Abyssal has the Hideous Merit, this Charm affects threatening rather than seductive influence.
#### Impossible Chilling Beauty
- Cost: 5m; Mins: Presence 3, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Indefinite
- Prerequisite Charms: Death's Alluring Face
- Drinking of the seductive allure of the grave, the Abyssal gains a +1 bonus to her Appearance. If this brings her Appearance above 5, her beauty is clearly unnatural to all who see it, though no less appealing for that fact. Her seductive persuade actions are always considered to exploit at least a Minor Intimacy, and the offer of physical intimacy from her, even as little as a kiss, always qualifies for at least a serious task when used in a bargain action towards a character of compatible orientation.
- With the Hideous Merit, rather than gaining seductive bonuses the Abyssal treats all characters as though they had a Minor Tie of fear towards her.
#### Dread Lord's Demeanor
- Cost: 6m; Mins: Presence 4, Essence 2
- Type: Simple
- Keywords: None
- Duration: One scene
- Prerequisite Charms: Elegant Tyrant's Majesty
- Cloaked in dark power, the Abyssal stands unquestioned. Those who would oppose her feel a sense of dread warning against that course of action, and should they ignore it deep wounds appear across their body as punishment for their impudence. Any character must pay one lethal health level the first time in the scene he wishes to speak against or attack the Abyssal. Furthermore, any threaten actions against the Abyssal suffer a dice penalty equal to her Essence.
#### Loving and Fearing Death
- Cost: 2m; Mins: Presence 5, Essence 2
- Type: Supplemental
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Death's Alluring Face
- Beauty and horror are but two sides of the same coin. When the Abyssal makes any social influence action, she can either gain the Hideous Merit or remove it for the purposes of that action. Her appearance does not change, rather, the targets of that influence look upon her grotesque visage and feel profound attraction, or are terrified by her comely appearance. Characters not subject to the influence are unaffected by this Charm, leaving them baffled by their associates' bizarre reactions.
- This Charm's effects on the perceptions of its targets lasts for the remainder of the scene. If the Abyssal uses it on the same targets again, their perceptions flip each time.
#### Uncanny Radiance Meditation
- Cost: - (+2m); Mins: Presence 4, Essence 2
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Impossible Chilling Beauty
- When The Abyssal activates Impossible Chilling Beauty, she can spend two extra motes to enhance it with this Charm. She ignores all penalties to her Appearance-based actions. Even caked in mud and blood, her unnatural beauty shines through, and when she lies at death's door her injuries somehow only accentuate her looks. She also ignores Minor Intimacies that oppose her Appearance-based social influence, as any small misgivings other characters might have melt away at the sight of her.
#### World-Scarring Loveliness
- Cost: - (1 Resonance); Mins: Presence 5, Essence 2
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: One scene
- Prerequisite Charms: Uncanny Radiance Meditation
- Creation cannot stand to look upon the true beauty of death, but with this Charm, the Abyssal forces it to anyway. While Impossible Chilling Beauty is active, she can use World-Scarring Loveliness to increase the Appearance bonus that Charm grants to +3. Using this Charm is free in the Underworld, but in other realms it instantly causes a point of Resonance gain.
#### Hands and Blades Tied
- Cost: 1m, 1wp; Mins: Presence 5, Essence 3
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: Clash
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: World-Scarring Loveliness, Dread Lord's Demeanour
- Try as they might to slay the deathknight who stands before them, her foes cannot force themselves to raise a hand against such a fair creature. She can reflexively clash attacks with (Appearance + Presence), gaining all the dice from high Appearance she would claim on appropriate social influence. If the Abyssal wins the clash, her attacker falters at the last second, or his arrows refuse to strike the Abyssal and instead drop out of the air to land at her feet. The attacker suffers the Defence penalty from a failed clash but takes no damage.
- Hands and Blades Tied can also be used to resist environmental hazards of any kind by rolling (Appearance + Presence) in place of the usual dice pool, gaining the Abyssal's full Appearance in non-Charm bonus dice. She can block uncountable damage in this way without any roll required. A single doleful glance parts a sea of lava as it rushes towards her, even the primal forces of the world refusing to bring any harm to such a lovely figure.
#### Heart-Stopping Glance
- Cost: 5m, 1wp; Mins: Presence 5, Essence 5
- Type: Simple
- Keywords: Decisive-only
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Soul-Flaying Gaze x2, Hands and Blades Tied
- As a victim meets the Abyssal's eyes, he sees her full, unimaginable beauty for just an instant. The shock of that glorious moment is enough to make most immediately pass on, completely contented, to their next incarnation.
- While at 15+ Initiative, the Abyssal makes a decisive attack through Soul-Flaying Gaze. Unlike most such attacks, this does count as seductive influence (or threatening if she is Hideous), and can therefore benefit from Death's Alluring Face. Her base damage is increased by her Appearance, and for every two bonus dice she would have gained from high Appearance over her target's Resolve, she doubles one number on damage. For instance, if she would have gained four or five dice she doubles 9s.
- Outside of combat, the Abyssal can use this Charm against a trivial combatant to kill him instantly. Doing so is not immediately apparent as an attack, though the fact that he spent his last moments staring at the Abyssal might draw suspicion.

## Sorcery
### Control Spells
#### Death of Obsidian Butterflies
Cost: 15sm, 1wp
Keywords: Decisive-only, Perilous
Duration: Instant
Sculpting Essence into volant black glass, the sorcerer unleashes a cascade of
obsidian butterflies. She rolls (Perception + Occult) as an undodgeable
decisive attack applied in a line against enemies out to medium range. This
line is wide enough to strike all opponents within the width of a single range
band and reaches high enough to strike aerial enemies who are at short range
to the ground (medium range enemies in the air can still be targeted by
directing the butterflies to fly along an upward path, rather than a
horizontal one). Battle groups are especially vulnerable to being cut down by
this spell, taking a -2 penalty to Defense against it.
The attack deals raw damage equal to the sorcerer's (Essence + extra successes),
or (Essence + Occult + extra successes) against a battle group. It does not
reset the sorcerer to base Initiative. Scenery made of wood, glass, or other
fragile materials is generally destroyed. After this spell has been cast, the
obsidian butterflies fall to the ground and shatter, creating terrain that may
be hazardous for barefooted characters to traverse—treat as an environmental
hazard inflicting two dice of lethal damage, difficulty 2 to resist with a
(Dexterity + Athletics) roll, and if the character is barefoot, difficult
terrain as well. Any character wearing armored boots can generally ignore the
debris.
A sorcerer who knows Death of Obsidian Butterflies as her control spell gains
(Essence) bonus dice to the spell's attack roll. When her emotions run hot,
butterfly silhouettes rise from her shadow. When she is angry, her fingernails
turn to sharp volcanic glass, making it possible to cut cloth or paper, rend
wood or flesh and other similar stunts.
#### Blood Lash
Cost: 10sm, 1lhl, 1wp
Keywords: None
Duration: Until dismissed
The sorcerer scourges her spirit with a masochistic invocation, forcing blood
from her open wounds to coalesce into a scarlet whip tipped with black barbs.
The whip has direlash traits (ACC +5, DMG +10, DEF +0, OVW 3; Tags: Lethal,
Melee, Natural, Disarming, Grappling, Flexible, Reaching). She halves wound
penalties, rounded down, when attacking, grappling, or parrying with it. This
spell's health-level cost is waived if the sorcerer has any non-bashing damage
in her health track.
The lash gains additional powers as the sorcerer's wound penalty rises:
- −1: Whipped Dog Infliction (3m; Reflexive; Instant): After damaging an enemy, the sorcerer reflexively rolls a threaten action against him. Wound penalties don't apply to it; they're instead converted to bonus dice.
- −2: Endless Crimson Coils (5m; Supplemental; Instant; Uniform): The lash extends to attack out to short range. If the sorcerer grapples an enemy at range, she may pull him to close range or leave him where she is. If she chooses the latter, an ally can free the grappled character from the clinch with a difficulty 3 gambit.
- −4: Bloodthirsty Scarlet Serpent (5m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; Decisive-only): The sorcerer makes a decisive attack as the blood lash grows a terrible fanged maw, draining her victim's vitality. She heals a level of non-aggravated damage for every 3 levels of damage dealt to a living nontrivial enemy, minimum 1. Waive Endless Crimson Coils' and Whipped Dog Infliction's costs. This power can only be used once per scene, unless reset by taking 7+ levels of decisive damage.
A sorcerer with this as her control spell may manipulate her own shed blood.
She can control any blood she sheds until it dries, causing it to move as she
wills. Using the blood to assist in actions provides exceptional equipment
bonuses (Exalted, p. 580). The blood can rarely attempt rolls by itself, but
if the Storyteller deems it possible, the sorcerer rolls normally. This power
has no range limit, but the sorcerer's senses aren't extended through her
blood.
Distortion (Goal Number: 10): The blood lash congeals, inflicting bashing
damage instead of lethal, and losing the Flexible tag. The sorcerer's wound
penalty is treated as one lower for purposes of the lash's powers.
### Shaping Rituals
#### Darkness of the Shadowlands
The sorcerer draws power from shadow and darkness, weaving it into her spells.
Whenever she begins a scene in darkness or shadow heavy enough to qualify as
concealment for attempting stealth, she gains three sorcerous motes, which
last until the end of the scene and can be spent towards any spells she casts.
Additionally, whenever she takes a shape sorcery action to shape a spell while
in stealth, she gains an additional sorcerous mote as long as the spell's
target is unaware of her. She also receives these benefits while under the
night sky during the new moon or Calibration, even without being concealed.
#### Dreams of a Long-Ago Initiation
When the sorcerer sleeps, her player may describe the fragmented visions of
her forgotten past that she dreams about. She recovers no Willpower from
sleep, instead rolling (Wits + Occult) and gaining one sorcerous mote per
success. These motes last until the next time she sleeps, and can be spent
towards any spell she casts. If the sorcerer spends all of the sorcerous motes
granted by a dream casting her control spell, each counts as two motes towards
meeting the spell's cost. Once per story, the sorcerer's player may stunt to
describe her sudden recollection of an event like the current situation, which
she resolved with sorcery. Doing so awards her a number of sorcerous motes
equal to (her Essence x [stunt level + 1]), which last for the duration of the
scene.
