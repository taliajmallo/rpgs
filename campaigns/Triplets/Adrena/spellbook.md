## Cantrips
- Detect Magic
  - Divination
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Component: V, S
  - Range 60 ft.
  - Area cone-shaped emanation
  - Duration concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no 
You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.

- Haunted Fae Aspect
  - Illusion (Glamour)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components S
  - Range Personal
  - Target You
  - Duration 1 round/level (D)
You surround yourself with disturbing illusions, making you look and sound like a bizarre, insane fey creature. You gain DR 1/cold iron against a single opponent until the end of the spell, or until you take damage.
- Mage Hand
  - Transmutation
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target one non-magical, unattended object weighing up to 5 lbs.
  - Duration concentration
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
You point your finger at an object and can lift it and move it at will from a distance. As a move action, you can propel the object as far as 15 feet in any direction, though the spell ends if the distance between you and the object ever exceeds the spell’s range.
- Message
  - Transmutation
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, F (a piece of copper wire)
  - Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
  - Targets one creature/level
  - Duration 10 min./level
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those nearby can hear these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point your finger at each creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the subject, and the path’s entire length lies within the spell’s range. The creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn’t transcend language barriers. To speak a message, you must mouth the words and whisper.
- Open/Close
  - Transmutation
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, F (a brass key)
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target object weighing up to 30 lbs. or portal that can be opened or closed
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw Will negates (object); Spell Resistance yes (object)
You can open or close (your choice) a door, chest, box, window, bag, pouch, bottle, barrel, or other container. If anything resists this activity (such as a bar on a door or a lock on a chest), the spell fails. In addition, the spell can only open and close things weighing 30 pounds or less. Thus, doors, chests, and similar objects sized for enormous creatures may be beyond this spell’s ability to affect.
- Prestidigitation
  - Universal
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range 10 ft.
  - Target, Effect, or Area see text
  - Duration 1 hour
  - Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance no
Prestidigitations are minor tricks that novice spellcasters use for practice. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. A prestidigitation can slowly lift 1 pound of material. It can color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round. It can chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material. It cannot deal damage or affect the concentration of spellcasters. Prestidigitation can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial. The materials created by a prestidigitation spell are extremely fragile, and they cannot be used as tools, weapons, or spell components. Finally, prestidigitation lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only 1 hour.
- Stabilize
  - Conjuration
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V,S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target one living creature
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)
Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has –1 or fewer hit points. That creature is automatically stabilized and does not lose any further hit points. If the creature later takes damage, it continues dying normally.
- Telekinetic Projectile
  - Evocation
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw no; Spell Resistance no
You fling an object weighing up to 5 pounds at the target. You must succeed at a ranged attack (not a ranged touch attack) to hit your target; if you hit, you deal 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage to both the target and the object. The type of object thrown doesn’t change the damage type or any other properties of the attack, even if you throw a weapon or magic item in this way.

## Level 1, Permanent
- Cure Light Wounds
  - Conjuration (Healing)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range touch
  - Target creature touched
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw Will half (harmless); see text; Spell Resistance yes (harmless); see text
When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply Spell Resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.
- Detect Thoughts
  - Divination (Mind-Affecting)
  - You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.
1st Round: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or higher).
2nd Round: Number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score of each. If the highest Intelligence is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can’t see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.
3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target’s Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast detect thoughts again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence (Int 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts.
Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
- Songbird
  - Conjuration (Good)
  - Casting Time 1 swift action
  - Components S
  - Range personal
  - Target you
  - Duration 1 round
You conjure uplifting music from the wilds of Elysium, Heaven, or Nirvana to bolster other musical activities.
If you cast songbird during the same round in which you attempt a Perform check, songbird acts as accompaniment and grants a +3 bonus on that Perform check.
If you cast songbird in the same round in which you activate a bardic performance, that round of bardic performance does not count against your total rounds of bardic performance available for the day.
If you cast songbird in the same round in which you cast a spell with the sonic descriptor, that spell’s save DC increases by 1.
- Tap Inner Beauty
  - Divination
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, M (a tiny mirror)
  - Range personal
  - Target you
  - Duration 1 minute/level

- Wave Shield 
  - Abjuration (Water)
  - Casting Time 1 immediate action
  - Components V
  - Range personal
  - Target you
  - Duration 1 round or until discharged
You create a rushing torrent of water in the rough outline of a shield. The water protects you from one physical or fire attack, granting you DR/— and fire resistance equal to half your caster level (minimum 1) on that attack. Once the spell has reduced the damage of one attack against you, it is discharged.

## Level 1, Amnesia
- [ ] Compel Hostility
  - Enchantment (Compulsion)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, M (a drop of your blood)
  - Range personal
  - Target you
  - Duration 1 round/level
  - Saving Throw see text; Spell Resistance see text
Whenever a creature you can see that threatens you makes an attack against one of your allies, as an immediate action, you can compel that creature to attack you instead. When you compel a creature to attack you, you must first overcome that creature’s spell resistance, and the creature can attempt a Will saving throw to ignore the compulsion. A summoner casting this spell can choose his eidolon as the target of the spell.
- [ ] Magic Missile
  - Evocation (Force)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
  - Targets up to five creatures, no two of which can be more than 15 ft. apart
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
A missile of magical energy darts forth from your fingertip and strikes its target, dealing 1d4+1 points of force damage.
The missile strikes unerringly, even if the target is in melee combat, so long as it has less than total cover or total concealment. Specific parts of a creature can’t be singled out. Objects are not damaged by the spell.
For every two caster levels beyond 1st, you gain an additional missile – two at 3rd level, three at 5th, four at 7th, and the maximum of five missiles at 9th level or higher. If you shoot multiple missiles, you can have them strike a single creature or several creatures. A single missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you check for spell resistance or roll damage.
- [x] Mind Thrust I
  - Divination (Mind-Affecting)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target one creature
  - Duration instantaneous

with a glut of psychic information. This attack deals 1d6 points of damage per 
caster level (maximum 5d6). The target receives a Will save for half damage. 
This attack has no effect on creatures without an Intelligence score.
- [x] Polypurpose Panacea
  - Transmutation
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components S
  - Range personal
  - Target you
  - Duration see below
This creates one of several cantrip-level effects relating to your health, well-being, and entertainment. The panacea has no side effects (for example, the intoxication panacea does not cause a hangover). When you use polypurpose panacea, choose one of the following effects.
Analgesic: You do not feel minor aches and pains, such as from arthritis, a cold, or a hangover, for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 resistance bonus against pain-related spells.
Clarity: You get a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check within 1 minute. You must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.
Hallucination: You have pleasant hallucinations for 1 hour, such as wandering lights, music, playful surreal animals, and so on. You can tell these are not real, but they are distracting, and you take a –2 penalty on Perception checks for the duration.
Intoxication: You feel comfortably intoxicated for 1 hour, as if you had a few alcoholic beverages.
Lucid Dream: If you take this panacea within 1 hour of going to sleep, you have a lucid dream that is under your control and lasts for an hour.
Resistance: You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saves for 1 minute.
Sleep: You enter a pleasant and restful sleep for at least 1 hour unless wakened. If you would normally begin sleeping at this time, when the panacea ends you continue sleeping normally.
Sobriety: You become completely sober for 1 hour, negating any penalties to your actions for being drunk (GameMastery Guide 237). Magical and alchemical methods (such as detect poison) still detect you as inebriated. Time spent under the effect of this panacea do not count toward the time necessary to sober up (it merely delays your intoxication).
Tenacity: You gain 1 temporary hit point for 1 minute.
Wakefulness: You remain awake for 2 hours without feeling sleepy, and without side effects such as jitteriness. You gain a +5 resistance bonus against sleep-related spells such as lullaby and sleep. This use of the panacea merely delays your need for sleep and does not count as rest or sleep. You can use it multiple times in succession, but as each effect wears off, you are as tired as you would be had you not used the panacea.

## Level 2, Permanent
- Soothing Word
  - Conjuration (Healing)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action

  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target 1 creature
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)
The target of this spell causes several conditions that he suffers from to be lessened in severity one step. If he is nauseated, he is instead sickened. If he is stunned, he is instead dazed. If he is exhausted, he is fatigued. If he is frightened, he is shaken. If he is paralyzed, he is staggered.

  - Saving Throw Will partial (see text); Spell Resistance no
An illusion of misty vapor inhabited by shadowy shapes arises around you. It is stationary. The illusory mist obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target). All creatures within the mist must save or take 1d2 points of Wisdom damage and gain the shaken condition. The shaken condition lasts as long as the creature remains in the mist.
- [x] Hold Person
  - Enchantment (Compulsion)

The subject becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but cannot take any actions, even speech. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full-round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A winged creature who is paralyzed cannot flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.
- [ ] Id Insinuation I
  - Enchantment (Compulsion, Mind-Affecting)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target one creature
  - Duration concentration + 1 round

- [ ] Instigate Psychic Duel
  - Illusion (Phantasm)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level) Targets one creature
  - Duration 1 minute/level
  - Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
You begin a psychic duel with a creature. This psychic duel takes place on a binary mindscape that includes only two minds: yours and the target’s. This spell ends and both minds return to their respective bodies if one of you drops below 0 hit points or if both of you agree to end the psychic duel (a free action that you can perform even if it isn’t your turn).
Even if you cast the spell, you must succeed at a Will save to escape your own psychic duel if your opponent doesn’t want to allow you to leave. Spells like mindscape door can also free you from the mindscape (and mindscape door is one of the few spells you can cast in a binary mindscape). A binary mindscape is clearly illusory, and disbelieving the illusion doesn’t alter how the mindscape works.
- [ ] Levitate
  - Transmutation 
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, F (a leather loop or golden wire bent into a cup shape)
  - Range personal or close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target you or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lbs./level)
  - Duration 1 min./level (D)
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
Levitate allows you to move yourself, another creature, or an object up and down as you wish. A creature must be willing to be levitated, and an object must be unattended or possessed by a willing creature. You can mentally direct the recipient to move up or down as much as 20 feet each round; doing so is a move action. You cannot move the recipient horizontally, but the recipient could clamber along the face of a cliff, for example, or push against a ceiling to move laterally (generally at half its base land speed).
A levitating creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a -1 penalty on attack rolls, the second -2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of -5. A full round spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at -1.
- [x] Mind Thrust II
  - Divination (Mind-Affecting)

The subject is fatigued for 1 minute after the spell ends.
- [ ] Shield Other
