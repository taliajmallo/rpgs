## Traits & Drawbacks
### Forgetful
Whenever you leave a location you have been at for longer than 1 hour, you must 
attempt a DC 10 Wisdom check. If you fail, you leave behind one random mundane 
item (a purse of money counts as an item).
### Magical Knack (Magic)
Your oracle caster level is increased by two. 
### Irrepressible (Faith)
You can use your Charisma modifier in place of your Wisdom modifier when 
attempting Will saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.
### Helpful (Combat)
When using the Aid Another action, you grant a +3 bonus instead of a +2 bonus. 

## Naiad Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, and you have land and swim speeds of 30 feet. You can 
breathe underwater, and have low-light vision. Your type is fae. 
### Inspiration (Su)
You can choose another intelligent creature to inspire by giving that creature a
token (typically a lock of your hair). As long as the creature carries your 
token and retains your favor, that creature gains a +1 insight bonus on Will 
saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. You retain a link to the token 
and its carrier as if you had cast a status spell on the carrier, informing you
of the direction and distance to the creature and any conditions affecting them. 
You can revoke this favor at any time as a free action, and may only inspire a 
single creature at any time with this ability. 
### Water Bond (Su)
You gain strength from a pond, lake, river, or other body of fresh water by 
bonding with it. While within 300 yards of your bonded body of water, you gain a 
+1 bonus to armor class and a +1 racial bonus to saving throws. Once per day as
a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you may forge a bond 
with a different body of fresh water. You may only be bonded to a single body of
water at a time with this ability. 
### Favored Class: Psychic IV
Gain +0.5 total spell points per rank. 

## Oracle Features
### Curse: Legalistic (Ex)
Whenever you break your word (either purposefully or unintentionally), you 
become sickened for 24 hours or until you meet your obligation, whichever comes 
first. However, once per day, you can make a vow to yourself that grants a +4 
morale bonus on any one roll you make while trying to fulfill a promise made to 
another individual.
### Inspiring Song (Ex)
Your voice provides inspiration to allies. This ability is identical to bardic 
performance (using Perform [sing] only), only allowing you to inspire courage. 
An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and 
fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. It is 
usable for 6 rounds (class level + Charisma modifier).

## Psychic Features
### Phrenic Pool (Su)
You have a phrenic pool of 7 (1/2 level + Charisma modifier) points that refresh
after 8 hours of rest or meditation. 
### Primal Spells
Add one spell of every level you can cast to both the psychic spell list and 
your spells known. You cast these spells as psychic spells, and once the spells
are chosen they cannot be changed. 
### Spell Recollection (Ex)
Half (rounded down) of your spell slots for your top two spell levels known are
amnesia slots, which can be used to recall spells once per hour as a swift 
action. When doing so, roll 1d100, adding 1d10 if in combat. Use the following 
table:
- 1-10	You cannot cast spells this round.
- 11-35	You fail to remember the spell.  
- 36-95	You remember, and can cast, the new spell. 
- 96+		You can treat this as 95, or can once per day cast a spell of one
			higher spell level than you can normally cast. 
### Phrenic Amplifications
#### Lesser Nature's Command (Ex)
You may spend 2 points from your phrenic pool to overcome a plant creature's 
immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This
ability functions even on mindless plants, but has no effect on non-plants, and
can only be linked to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor. 
#### Will of the Dead (Su)
You may spend 2 points from your phrenic pool to overcome an undead creature's 
immunity to mind-affecting effects for the purposes of the linked spell. This
ability functions even on mindless undead, but has no effect on non-undead, and
can only be linked to spells that have the mind-affecting descriptor. 
### Psychic Discipline: Rebirth
#### Past-Life Memories (Ex)
You add a +2 bonus equal (half your level) to all Knowledge checks and can 
attempt all Knowledge skill checks untrained.
#### Mnemonic Esoterica (Ex)
Once per day when you prepare your spells, you can add one spell from the 
Wizard spell list to your spells known and class spell list for 24 hours. 
This spell must be 1 level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast, 
and you cast it as if it were psychic magic.
### Detect Thoughts (Sp)
You can use Detect Thoughts as a spell-like ability once per day. You may also 
expend any unused spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast detect thoughts. If
you do so, you use the level of the spell slot expended to determine the Will 
save DC. 

## Feats 
### Eldritch Blending (1st)
Merge any spell-point pools you have from all classes you have. 
### Eldritch Aptitude (1st Antihero) 
The maximum number of bonus spell-points you can receive from a high 
spellcasting ability score is equal to your caster level, rather than your 
maximum spell level. Additionally, when your caster level reaches 10 or higher, 
you gain an additional set of bonus spell-points equal to your spellcasting 
ability score bonus.
### Lingering Performance (3rd)
The bonuses and penalties from your bardic performance continue for 2 rounds 
after you cease performing. Any other requirement, such as range or specific 
conditions, must still be met for the effect to continue. If you begin a new 
bardic performance during this time, the effects of the previous performance 
immediately cease.
### Heavy Armor Proficiency (5th)
You are proficient with heavy armor.
