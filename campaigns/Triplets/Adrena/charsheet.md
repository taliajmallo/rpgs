## Traits & Drawbacks
### Umbral Unmasking (Drawback)
You cast no shadow whatsoever, or the shadow you do have is monstrous. Under
normal lighted conditions, this is not hard to observe—but uncommon to notice.
Creatures that succeed at a DC 15 Wisdom check notice it plainly (an additional
Perception check may be required based on environmental conditions). This
telltale sign of wickedness cannot be concealed by misdirection, nondetection,
or illusions, except those that also affect shadows (such as invisibility).
### Chillblight Emissary (Region)
You gain DR 1/cold iron but become sickened for 1 round if damaged by a cold
iron weapon.
### Unnatural Presence (Faith)
Your prolonged association with dark forces leaks from your pores. You can use
your Intimidate skill to demoralize animals and vermin; Intimidate is a class
skill for you.
### Finding Your Past (Campaign)
You can't remember most of your past, but you feel a connection to the art of
the kineticist, channeling powerful elemental energies to shape the world as you
see fit, and you suspect that your past self was a master kineticist of some
nature. As such, you are devoted to that class above all others - it must be
your favored class, and your favored class benefits grant an additional hitpoint
and skill point over their other benefit(s).

## Death-Touched Naiad Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, and you have land and swim speeds of 30 feet. You can
breathe underwater, and have 60' darkvision. Your type is Fae with the
Dhampir and Water subtypes.
### Light Sensitivity
You are dazzled in areas of bright sunlight or within the radius of a Daylight
spell, unless using your Basic Chaokinesis to create a shadow around yourself.
### Negative Energy Affinity
Despite being a living creature, you react to positive and negative energy as if
undead - positive energy harms you while negative energy heals you.
### Undead Resistance
You have a +2 on saving throws against disease and mind-affecting effects.
###  Resist Energy Drain
You take no penalties from energy drain effects, though you are still killed if
you accrue more negative levels than your hit dice. After 24 hours, any negative
levels you accrue are removed without the need for an additional saving throw.
### Manipulative
You gain a +2 racial bonus on Bluff and Perception checks.
### Undead Affinity
You may use Detect Undead as a spell-like ability up to three times a day, using
your character level as your caster level.
### Favored Class: Kineticist
Add 1/4 to the save DC of the kineticist’s void infusions and wild talents.



## Dark Chaokineticist Features
### Kinetic Blast (Su)
PLACEHOLDER B/C THIS IS ALL GOING IN FOUNDRY ANYWAYS
### Dark Studies (Ex)
All Knowledge as class skills
### Soul Power (Su)
Throw burn at dead souls
### Gather Power (Su)
Placeholder
### Metakinesis (Su)
Empower for 1 burn
### Infusion Specialization (Ex)
Reduce burn cost of all blasts you make by 1, down to 0
### Infusions
#### Damping (1st Level Infusion)
- Substance Infusion
- Associated Blasts: Negative, Void
- Burn: 1
Your blast is infused with darkness, making it harder for your foes to see. If
your blast hits a foe (and penetrates SR if applicable), that foe must succeed
at a Will save or be dazzled for 1 minute, whether or not it takes damage from
the blast. You can reduce the blast’s damage by half to increase the DC of this
save by 2.
#### Spindle (3rd Level Infusion)
- Form Infusion
- Associated Blasts: All
- Burn: 2
You throw a long, roughly 5-foot-by-10-foot spindle of elemental matter or
energy up to 30 feet away, damaging all creatures and objects within any two
adjacent 5-foot squares unless they succeed at a Reflex save. An energy blast
infused with spindle deals its normal damage to each target, while a physical
blast infused with spindle deals half its normal damage to each target. The
saving throw DC is Dexterity-based.
#### Elemental Trap (5th Level Infusion)
- Form Infusion
- Associated Blasts: All
- Burn: 2
You touch an area of natural ground, drawing up elemental energy that roils just
below the surface, ready to explode when stepped on. This 5-foot square
detonates when triggered by a weight of 10 pounds or more, affecting all
creatures within 10 feet of the trap with your simple blast (or composite blast,
if you have it). Any creature other than the one that triggered the elemental
trap can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. The elemental trap lasts until
the next time you use this wild talent or until it triggers. This counts as a
magical trap with a Perception and Disable Device DC equal to 10 + your
kineticist level + your Dexterity modifier. You can accept 2 points of burn,
which cannot be reduced with gather power, to make a new trap without dismissing
any previous traps. If you do, the trap lasts until the next time you recover
burn.
### Wild Utility Talents
#### Basic Chaokinesis (Basic Utility)
You can create a shadow that protects a target from bright light. You can also
change gravity to increase a creature’s carrying capacity by half or grant a
creature a +4 bonus on Acrobatics checks to jump. Each benefit lasts 1 hour or
until you use basic chaokinesis again.
#### Emptiness (Defense)
Your body becomes an empty husk, fueled by an internal void. You gain negative
energy resistance 2, a 5% chance to ignore critical hits and sneak attacks, and
a +1 bonus on Will saves against emotion effects. By accepting 1 point of burn,
you can increase the resistance to negative energy by 2, the chance to ignore
critical hits and sneak attacks by 5%, and the bonus on Will saves against
emotion effects by 1 until the next time your burn is removed. The chance of
ignoring critical hits and sneak attacks granted by this wild talent stacks with
the chance granted by elemental overflow to a maximum of 100%. When you accept
burn while using a void wild talent, your bonus on Will saves applies against
all mind-affecting effects for 1 round. You can dismiss and restore this effect
as an immediate action.
#### Void Healer (2nd Level Utility Talent)
- Burn: 1
With a touch, you can heal a willing undead creature of an amount of damage
equal to your kinetic blast’s damage. Instead of paying the burn cost yourself,
you can cause the recipient to take 1 point of burn. If you do so, the recipient
takes 1 point of nonlethal damage per Hit Die he possesses, as usual for burn;
this damage can’t be healed by any means until the recipient takes a full
night’s rest.
#### Elemental Whispers (4th Level Utility Talent)
A piece of your soul has splintered off due to the dark techniques you've relied
upon for resurrection. This acts as a Sea Krait familiar with the Sage archetype,
but only manifests a corporeal form while you concentrate on it. It has an
intelligence of 5 + your level, may attempt all knowledge checks untrained, and
gains a bonus to knowledge checks equal to half your level. It gains two skill
points per level. While it is not corporeally manifested, you gain a +2 to
Fortitude saves, and may use its knowledge skills in place of your own.

## Feats
### Heir to Power Unstable (1st Antihero)
Any creature that is a member of your family, including Mezshmek, is immune to
all damage from your energy blasts and have DR 2/- per hit die against your
physical blasts.
Gathering power effects things near you, at the following radii:
- Within 10', cloud-based effects drift into your square, and a harmless layer of frost covers you and all surfaces.
- Within 20', all non-magical flames are extinguished unless protected with an immediate action by someone within reach of them, and the ambient temperature drops by 10 degrees.
- Within 30', all tiny or smaller unattended objects roll or slide up to 10' towards you.
- Within 40', all creatures may move 5' towards you as a free action that does not provoke AoOs.
Whenever you use a blast after gathering power or suffer burn, you release a
shockwave that affects nearby creatures within 20':
- First, make a bull rush as a free action, using INT instead of STR and adding your Burn as a circumstance bonus.
- Against all creatures pushed 10' or more, also make a trip attempt as a free action, similar to the bull rush.
- All creatures knocked prone must succeed at at Reflex save against your Kinetic Blast DC or take 1/4 your Kinetic Blast's damage.
### Brutal Blast (1st)
Your form infusions use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Dexterity to
calculate saving throws.
### Kinetic Prodigy (3rd)
You can consider yourself 1 kineticist level higher for the purposes of
selecting infusion wild talents. In addition, any kinetic blast you use that is
altered by an infusion gains a +1 bonus to damage. At 8th level, and again at
16th level, increase this bonus by 1. In any round in which you accept burn due
to using an infusion, increase this bonus by 1.
### Precision Blast (5th)
Whenever you use a kinetic blast that affects more than a single target or
square, you may select a square within its area to not be affected by your blast.
For each 2 points of burn you have, you may select an additional square to be
unaffected by your blast.
