## Traits & Drawbacks
### Forgetful (Drawback)
Whenever you leave a location you have been at for longer than 1 hour, you must
attempt a DC 10 Wisdom check. If you fail, you leave behind one random mundane
item (a purse of money counts as an item).
### Unorthodox Method (Regional)
Gain the Radiant Dawn discipline instead of the Shattered Mirror discipline.
### Practiced Initiator (Combat)
Gain +2 to your Knight-Chandler initiator level, up to your hit dice.
### Child of Nature (Religion)
Gain a +2 trait bonus on Survival checks to find food and water, and a +1 trait
bonus on Knowledge (Nature) checks. Survival is always a class skill for you.

## Naiad Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, and you have land and swim speeds of 30 feet. You can
breathe underwater, and have low-light vision. Your type is fae.
### Inspiration (Su)
You can choose another intelligent creature to inspire by giving that creature a
token (typically a lock of your hair). As long as the creature carries your
token and retains your favor, that creature gains a +1 insight bonus on Will
saving throws, Craft checks, and Perform checks. You retain a link to the token
and its carrier as if you had cast a status spell on the carrier, informing you
of the direction and distance to the creature and any conditions affecting them.
You can revoke this favor at any time as a free action, and may only inspire a
single creature at any time with this ability.
### Water Bond (Su)
You gain strength from a pond, lake, river, or other body of fresh water by
bonding with it. While within 300 yards of your bonded body of water, you gain a
+1 bonus to armor class and a +1 racial bonus to saving throws. Once per day as
a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you may forge a bond
with a different body of fresh water. You may only be bonded to a single body of
water at a time with this ability.
### Fae Nature (Ex)
You have a +2 racial bonus on Handle Animal and Knowledge (Nature) checks.
### Favored Class: Mystic IV
Gain +1/4 of an Elemental Flux or Mithril Current maneuver.

## Psychokineticist Features
### Emotional Intensity (Ex)
Use WIS instead of CON for all kineticist abilities. If you would ever be unable
to use a spell with an emotion component, you cannot use your wild talents, and
if you ever have immunity to charm, compulsion, or emotion effects, you
temporarily lose access to all kineticist abilities.
### Elemental Focus, Water (Su)
Knowledge (Nature) and Swim are class skills for you. You gain a basic energy
blast that deals cold damage, and you gain the Basic Hydrokinesis utility talent.
#### Basic Hydrokinesis
You can create water as the cantrip create water, purify water as if using
purify food and drink, and dry wet creatures and objects as if using
prestidigitation. While you cannot lift water into the air using this ability,
you can create mild currents in a body of water by concentrating. These currents
are strong enough to run a water mill as if the mill were being turned manually
by a creature with a Strength score equal to your Wisdom score.
### Kinetic Blast (Sp)
You may make kinetic blasts with a range of 30 feet. Your energy blasts deal
1d6 + 2 (1/2 WIS) damage.
### Mind Burn (Ex)
You suffer a -2 penalty on Will saves, Wisdom checks, and Wisdom-based skill
checks per point of burn you have accepted. You may accept at most 4 (WIS) burn.
### Gather Power (Su)
You may spend a move action to reduce the burn of your next kinetic blast by one.
You may instead spend a full-round action to reduce it by two, and may spend a
move action on the subsequent round to reduce it by another one.
### Infusion (Su)
You know the following infusions:
- Extended Range
Form infusion. Increased burn by 1, and increases range to 120'.

## Mystic Knight-Chandler Features
### Lesser Animus (Su)
You gain an animus pool. At the start of each turn, and at the end of each turn
in which you initiate a manuever, add a point of animus to your pool.
### Elemental Attunement (Su)
You may attune to a single active element: air (electricity), earth (acid), fire
(fire), or water (cold). You may change this element as a standard action, or as
a free action when changing your stance by spending a point of animus.
Whenever you deal damage with a maneuver, you may spend a point of animus to
change the type of any damage done to that of your current active element.
### Blade Meditation (Su)
As a full-round action, you may spend one point of animus to grant yourself all
remaining withheld maneuvers, then immediately expend them. Creatures that
target you with a melee attack take 1d6 points of elemental damage, +1d6 per two
points of animus you have.
### Arcane Defense (Ex)
Gain a +1 insight bonus to AC and saves against spells, psionic powers,
spell-like abilities, and psi-like powers. This increases by +1 at 6th, 11th,
16th, and 20th level.
### Mystic Artifice (Su)
You can treat your Mystic level as your caster level for item creation, and may
attempt a spellcraft check to replicate spells for the purpose of crafting.
### Soul Candle (Su)
You have a soul candle. It produces bright light with a radius of twice your
Illumination, and normal light for double that. The candle remains within one
mile of you at all times; you can move it within that area up to your speed once
per round as a free action. If you move in any way such that it would be further
than a mile from you, it is moved immediately to be within a mile of you. Any
time you teleport, you may include the candle in the teleportation. As a swift
action, you may recall the candle to you.
You have an Illumination pool. When not in combat, your Illumination may be at
most 1. At the start of every turn in combat, and at the end of every turn
during which you use a boost, you gain an additional Illumination. You may focus
as a swift action to gain 2 Illumination immediately. Illumination persists for
one minute after the encounter ends, at which point it resets back to 1.
Allies within 15 feet of the candle gain energy resistance against your active
element equal to your Illumination, up to a maximum of 8 (WIS + class level).
### Illumination (Su)
Whenever you hit with an attack, you can illuminate the target as with Faerie
Fire, applying a -20 penalty to all Stealth checks and negating concealment,
blur, displacement, invisibility, and such, with a duration of 5 (initiator
level) minutes.
Additionally, you deal +5 (initiator level) damage on attacks made as part of a
strike against enemies that threaten an ally other than yourself.
### Candle Magic (Su)
You may sustain a single Votive effect about your candle, which affects all
allies within 15 feet of your candle. You may change the current effects as a
swift action.
#### Votive Effects:
- Allies gain a morale bonus against mind-affecting abilities equal to your Illumination, up to +4 (WIS).
- Allies gain an elemental damage bonus on attacks equal to your Illumination, up to +4 (class level).
- Allies can move 5 feet as a swift action without provoking AoOs.
- Allies can use a swift action to gain non-stacking temporary HP equal to your Illumination, up to 4 (class level).
### Maneuvers
You know 10+1 maneuvers and 3 stances. You must ready 6 maneuvers, which you
have access to in combat. Of those, choose two to be immediately granted. At the
start of your first turn in combat, you gain access to those two, as well as an
additional one randomly-determined maneuver.
At the end of each turn in combat, one randomly-determined maneuver that you
have readied but not yet granted is granted. If there are no remaining such
maneuvers, you instead restore all expended maneuvers, choose two to grant
immediately, and randomly grant another (as with the start of combat.)
Any strikes may instead use a ranged touch attack that deals force damage equal
to 1d6 + 4 (WIS) on-hit to a single target within 35' (25 + 5/2 level).
- Staunching Strike (Radiant Dawn I)
Standard (strike). Make an attack. If it hits, divide 7 (WIS mod + 3/essence) HP
of healing between yourself and any allies within 35' (25 + 5/2 levels).
- Dismiss (Radiant Dawn I)
Standard (strike). Make an attack. If it hits, make a trip attempt with a +2
(+2/essence) bonus, using your level instead of your BAB, and using your WIS
modifier instead of your Strength modifier. If it succeeds, the target is pushed
away as if you bull rushed them with the same die roll as your trip.
- Variable Flux (Elemental Flux I)
Standard (strike). Make an attack with effects based on your active element.
Saving throws are DC 15 (11 + WIS).
  - Air: If the target is wearing metal armor, wielding a metal shield, or wielding a weapon mostly composed of metal, you gain a +4 bonus on your attack roll.
  - Earth: If your attack hits, the target must succeed at a Will save or become sickened for one round.
  - Fire: If your attack hits, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or catch on fire for 1d4 rounds.
  - Water: If your attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become fatigued for one round.
- Spark Strike (Elemental Flux I)
Standard (strike, animus). Make an attack that deals +2d4 elemental damage. You
may spend one point of animus to increase the bonus damage to +3d4.
- Solar Sting (Solar Wind I)
Standard (strike). Choose a target 10' by 10' area within range, and make an
attack roll to hit that location (Base AC 5). The area is covered with softly
glowing caltrops, and counts as difficult terrain. Any creature that enters the
area or starts its turn in the area is attacked by the caltrops, which have a
+4 (WIS) attack bonus against AC, and deny the target's armor, shield, and
deflection bonuses. However, boots and heavy foot gear confer a +2 to AC against
the caltrops. On a hit, caltrops deal 1d2 damage and halve the target's speed
until it receives healing.
- Strike the Hourglass (Riven Hourglass I)
Standard (strike). Make an attack. If it hits, it deals normal damage and the
target must make a DC 15 (11 + WIS) Will save or may only take a single move or
standard action on its next turn.
- Curate's Strike (Radiant Dawn II)
Standard (strike). Make an attack. If it hits, divide 12 (2*WIS mod + 4/essence)
HP of healing between yourself and any allies within 35' (25 + 5/2 levels). You
may instead offer a single ally a saving throw against an ongoing effect that
offers multiple saves or has a duration measured in rounds.
- Cursed Fate (Veiled Moon II)
Standard (strike, mind-affecting). Make an attack. On a hit, deal +2d6 damage,
and the target must make a DC 16 (12 + WIS) Will save or suffer a -4 to all d20
rolls until the start of your next turn.
- Arcane Shield (Elemental Flux II)
Immediate (counter, force). In response to being attacked by a melee or ranged
attack, including touch or ranged touch attacks, make a Spellcraft check with a
DC of the attack roll. If you succeed, the attack is negated. This is a force
effect, and may be used to block incorporeal attacks. You may spend one point of
animus to leave a lingering echo of the shield, granting a +2 shield bonus to AC
until the start of your next turn.
- Elemental Strike (Elemental Flux II)
Standard (strike). Make an attack with effects based on your active element.
Saving throws are DC 16 (12 + WIS).
  - Air: If your attack hits, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone from the force of the blow.
  - Earth: If your attack hits, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or take an additional 2d6 points of acid damage at the start of your next turn.
  - Fire: If your attack hits, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or be blinded by the smoke and flames for one round.
  - Water: If your attack hits, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become nauseated for one round from the chilling cold.
- Lance of Power (Elemental Flux III)
Standard (strike, animus). In a 30' line of energy, deal 5d6 elemental damage
and apply a secondary effect. A Reflex save DC 17 (13 + WIS) halves damage and
negates secondary effects.
You may spend up to five points of animus to increase the damage of this strike
by 2d6 per point of animus spent and increase the save DC of this strike by +1
per point of animus spent. Damage dice cannot exceed your level.
  - Air: The crack of thunder accompanying the lightning deafens creatures for 4 (WIS) rounds.
  - Earth: The acid spray also creates a greasy, oily slick, causing creatures who fail their Reflex saves to drop items they are holding as if affected by the grease spell.
  - Fire: The intensity of the flaming blast adds an additional +1 point of damage per die and dazzles each target for 4 (WIS) rounds.
  - Water: The icy blast makes surfaces very slippery, and creatures who fail their Reflex saves slip on the ice and fall prone.
### Stances
You know the following stances:
- Spoils of War (Radiant Dawn I)
Allies within 35' (25 + 5/2 levels) heal 9 HP (3 base + 2/essence + WIS mod) on
successful attacks they make, once per round per ally.
- Stance of Piercing Rays (Solar Wind I)
Your ranged attacks deal +1d6 fire damage, increasing by 1d6 every 8 levels.
- Elemental Flux Stance (Elemental Flux III)
Your attacks deal +2d6 elemental damage, you gain 15 energy resistance against
your active element, and you gain one of the following effects:
  - Air: Your speed and perception are heightened, granting you a +4 bonus on initiative checks and a +4 dodge bonus to your AC.
  - Earth: The strength and durability of the earth suffuses your bones, granting you DR 5/adamantine.
  - Fire: Your body is filled with warmth and healing light, granting you fast healing 1. In addition, you glow like a torch as if under the effect of a light spell.
  - Water: Your body is inured against debilitating effects, granting you a +2 bonus on all saving throws.

Gain the oracle Legalistic Curse. You may never take levels in a class that
grants divine spellcasting, and suffer a -2 penalty on all saving throws against
divine spells cast by worshippers of Shyka.
#### Legalistic Curse
Whenever you break your word (either purposefully or unintentionally), you
become sickened for 24 hours or until you meet your obligation, whichever comes
first. However, once per day, you can make a vow to yourself that grants a +4
morale bonus on any one roll you make while trying to fulfill a promise made to
another individual.
- At 10th character level, you gain a +3 competence bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks while talking to an individual one-on-one.

form of a memory borrowed from someone familiar with the subject matter.
