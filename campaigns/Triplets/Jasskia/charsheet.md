## Traits & Drawbacks
### Attached
You have a strong emotional attachment to Cilanthia, your younger sister. 
Whenever she is either threatened, in danger, or in someone else's possession, 
you take a -1 penalty on Will saves and a -2 penalty on saves against fear 
effects. If she is ever lost, killed, or destroyed, exchange this drawback for 
the Doubt drawback. 
### Two-World Magic
Add the Lift spell word to your spell words known.  
### Criminal
You spent your early life robbing and stealing to get by. Select one of the 
following skills: **Disable Device**, ~~Intimidate~~, or ~~Sleight of Hand~~. 
You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you. 
### Clever Wordplay
You may use your Intelligence instead of your Charisma for the purposes of the 
Diplomacy skill.

## Racial Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, you have a speed of 30 feet, and you have darkvision to a 
range of 60 feet. 
### Sea Lungs (Sea Hag Mother)
The changeling may hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to three times 
her Constitution before she risks drowning.
### Hag Magic
Hag Magic: Some changelings develop a gift for spellcasting instead of their 
mothers’ overtly fearsome traits. A changeling with this trait displays one or 
more stark white streaks in her hair as a child. The DCs of any saving throws 
against enchantment spells she casts increase by 1, and if her Charisma score is 
11 or higher, she also gains the following spell-like abilities, usable once per 
day each: dancing lights, detect magic, disguise self, and pass without trace. 
The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to the changeling’s 
character level. The DC for these spell-like abilities is equal to 10 + the 
spell’s level + the changeling’s Charisma modifier. 
### Favored Class Bonus - Witch IV
Each time you take this benefit, gain a witch spell word to your spell words 
known. This word must be at least one level below the highest word level you can 
cast. 

## Witch Class Features
### Patron: The Lost Prince (Peace)
You gain the Peacebond hex at first level. Your patron requires that you remain 
neutral to conflict whenever possible, and you cannot take an action that causes 
damage against creatures who have not damaged another in the last 24 hours. Gain 
the following patron spells at the specified levels: 
	2.  Sanctuary
	4.  Touch of Mercy
	6.  Mantle of Calm
	8.  Dismissal
	10. Serenity
	12. Word of Recall
	14. Hymn of Peace
	16. Euphoric Tranquility
	18. Antipathy
### Familiar - Flowering Lattice
You gain +3 to Bluff checks and the benefits of the Alertness feat (+2 to 
Perception and Sense Motive checks, increased to +4 at 10 ranks). 
#### Bountiful Fruits
Once per week, a flowering lattice produces a handful of small fruits or berries 
that remain ripe for 1 week. Eating all of the fruit takes 1 minute and affects 
the eater as if she had consumed a berry affected by goodberry.
### Season - Winter
The save DCs of any of your spells that deal cold damage increase by 1. 
### Hexes
DC 17 (10 + 1/2 Witch level + INT Mod)
#### Conduit Surge
As a swift action, increase your effective caster level for the next spell you 
cast by 1d4-1. Afterwards, make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + spell level + caster 
level increase) or become staggered for a number of minutes equal to the spell
level. At 8th level, the caster level  increase changes to 1d4. You can use this 
5 (3 + CHA Mod) times per day. 
#### Peacebond 
As a standard action, prevent a creature from drawing a weapon for a number of
rounds equal to your Witch level. This has no effect on natural weapons or 
already-drawn weapons. A Will save negates, and once a creature has been 
targeted by this hex, they cannot be targeted again for a day. 
#### Healing 
As a standard action, cast cure light wounds without using a spell slot. At 5th
level, this allows you to cast cure moderate wounds instead. Once a creature has 
been affected by this hex, they cannot be affected again for a day. 
#### Protective Luck 
As a standard action, warp fate around a creature other than you for 1 round. 
Whenever it is targeted by an effect that requires an attack roll, including 
weapon attacks, the attacker must roll twice and take the worst result. The 
duration increases by 1 round at 8th and 16th level, and is affected by any 
hexes that affect the Fortune hex.  
#### Invest Hex
Each day, you may implant 7 (INT Mod + half Witch level) hexes in willing 
creatures. A creature may only have one hex implanted at a time, and implanting 
a hex counts against the any limits of using that hex. Implanting a hex is a 
standard action during which you touch a willing creature. You may activate the 
hex as a free action at any time you are within medium range, or you may specify 
a condition when you implant the hex upon which it will automatically trigger. 
Implanted hexes last until the next time you regain your spells. 

## VMC Class Features
### Mystery of Life
Divine entities have gifted you with supernatural powers of healing, much to 
your confusion and chagrin.
### Curse of the Merciful
You are cursed with a supernatural compulsion to render aid to any who request 
it. If a non-enemy character asks you to heal them, or asks you for help and you 
can tell they have taken damage or drain or suffer from a disease or poison, you 
must help them on your next turn. If they have a condition or suffer from a 
poison or disease that you can neutralize or cure ith any ability you possess or 
any spell you can cast, you must do so as your next action. Otherwise, if they 
have taken any damage, you must cast a spell or use an ability that heals hit 
points. Also, you cannot perform a coup de grace. 
You gain the ability to lay on hands, as the paladin ability, using your curse 
level (1/2 character level via VMC, +5 at character level 11) as your paladin 
level.
- At 5th curse level (10th character level), you gain a mercy, as the paladin ability.
- At 10th curse level (11th character level), you gain a second mercy, and can exchange your first mercy for a different one.
- At 15th curse level (20th character level), you gain a third mercy, and can exchange one of your existing mercies for a different one.
#### Lay on Hands (Merciful)
You may cure wounds with a touch 3 (1/4 character level + CHA mod) times per day, 
healing 1d6 (1d6 / 4 character levels, min 1d6) damage. This is a standard 
action when used on another target, or a swift action when used on yourself. 
### Revelation: Life Link
As a standard action, you may create a bond between yourself and another 
creature. Each round at the start of your turn, if the bonded creature is 
wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit 
points and you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have a single bond active at 
a time, plus an additional bond for every level after 5th. This bond continues 
until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other 
creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have 
multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same 
immediate action).

## Feats 
### Healer's Touch (1st)
After curing a cumulative total of 1000 points of damage, plus 2 for every point 
of damage dealt, your healing spells always restores their maximum possible 
hitpoints when used on a target other than yourself. 
### Mystic Healer (1st Antihero)
Add additional dice to any form of healing you generate. This starts as +1d4, 
increasing to 1d6 at 4th level, 2d6 at 7th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at
13th level.
