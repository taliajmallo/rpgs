## Traits & Drawbacks
### Family Ties (Drawback)
When a family member makes a request of you, you must fulfill that request or 
take a –2 penalty on all Wisdom– and Charisma-based ability checks and skill 
checks until you either do what was requested or succeed at a DC 20 Will saving 
throw, which you can attempt once per day at the start of each day. You can’t 
take this drawback if you have no family. If you ever lose your family or lose 
contact with your family, exchange this drawback for the Doubt drawback.
### Family Trade (Family)
Bluff is a class skill for you, and if a family member with the Family Trade 
trait is within 60 feet of you, gain a +2 trait bonus to Bluff checks. 
### Dealer (Regional)
You spent your early life robbing and stealing to get by. You gain a +1 trait 
bonus to **Sleight-of-Hand**, and it is always a class skill for you. 
### Affable (Social)
You gain a +2 trait bonus on Diplomacy checks to gather information, and can do 
so in half the normal time. In addition, Diplomacy and Knowledge (local) are 
always class skills for you.

## Racial Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, you have a speed of 30 feet, and you have darkvision to a 
range of 60 feet. 
### Green Widow (Green Hag Mother)
The changeling gains a +2 racial bonus on Bluff checks against creatures that 
are sexually attracted to her.
### Hag Magic
Hag Magic: Some changelings develop a gift for spellcasting instead of their 
mothers’ overtly fearsome traits. A changeling with this trait displays one or 
more stark white streaks in her hair as a child. The DCs of any saving throws 
against enchantment spells she casts increase by 1, and if her Charisma score is 
11 or higher, she also gains the following spell-like abilities, usable once per 
day each: dancing lights, detect magic, disguise self, and pass without trace. 
The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to the changeling’s 
character level. The DC for these spell-like abilities is equal to 10 + the 
spell’s level + the changeling’s Charisma modifier. 
### Favored Class Bonus - Witch IV
Each time you take this benefit, gain a witch spell word to your spell words 
known. This word must be at least one level below the highest word level you can 
cast. 

## Witch Class Features
### Patron: The Green Mother (Enchantment)
You gain the Seduce hex at first level. Your patron demands that you use your 
gifts skillfully, and any time a target of one of your mind-affecting hexes or 
spells succeeds on their saving throw against the spell or hex, take damage 
equal to their save result minus the spell or hex's DC, to a maximum of your hit
dice. 
Replacement spells: Glamour (2) Nixie's Lure (6), Wave of Ecstasy (14)
### Familiar: Sigrissa
You have the aid of a viper familiar, sent by the Green Mother. 
### Season - Winter
The save DCs of any of your spells that deal cold damage increase by 1. 
### Hexes
DC 17 (10 + 1/2 Witch level + CHA Mod)
#### Charm (1st)
A witch can charm an animal or humanoid creature within 30 feet by beckoning and 
speaking soothing words. This improves the attitude of an animal or humanoid 
creature by 1 step, as if the witch had successfully used the Diplomacy skill. 
The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the Witch’s Intelligence 
modifier. A Will save negates this effect. Whether or not the save is successful, 
a creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 1 day. At 8th level, this 
effect improves the attitude of the target creature by 2 steps. This is a mind-
affecting charm effect.
The save DC of this hex is increased by 1. If the target is (or could be) 
sexually attracted to the seducer, the save DC is instead increased by 2. If she 
and the target have had willing sexual relations in the past 24 hours, the save 
DC is instead increased by 3.
#### Seduce (Bonus)
The witch uses enthralling movements to fascinate a single creature within 60 
feet that can see the witch. A Will save negates this effect. If the target is 
(or could be) sexually attracted to the witch, the save DC is increased by 2. 
The effect lasts for 1 round, but the witch can extend this effect for 1 
additional round (up to a total number of rounds equal to her class level) by 
taking a standard action to continue her enthralling movements. Whether or not 
the target succeeds at its save, it cannot be the target of this ability again 
for 1 day. At 8th level, the fascination effect lasts for 2 additional rounds 
after the witch ceases taking a standard action to maintain it. This is a mind-
affecting charm effect.
#### Healing (Bonus)
As a standard action, cast cure light wounds without using a spell slot. At 5th
level, this allows you to cast cure moderate wounds instead. Once a creature has 
been affected by this hex, they cannot be affected again for a day. 
#### Peacebond (2nd)
As a standard action, prevent a creature from drawing a weapon for a number of
rounds equal to your Witch level. This has no effect on natural weapons or 
already-drawn weapons. A Will save negates, and once a creature has been 
targeted by this hex, they cannot be targeted again for a day. 
#### Protective Luck (4th) 
As a standard action, warp fate around a creature other than you for 1 round. 
Whenever it is targeted by an effect that requires an attack roll, including 
weapon attacks, the attacker must roll twice and take the worst result. The 
duration increases by 1 round at 8th and 16th level, and is affected by any 
hexes that affect the Fortune hex.  

## Feats 
### Cursed Atonement (1st)
Gain Curse of the Merciful. You may never take levels in a class that grants 
divine spellcasting, and suffer a -2 penalty on all saving throws against 
divine spells cast by worshippers of Sarenrae. 
#### Curse of the Merciful
You are cursed with a supernatural compulsion to render aid to any who request 
it. If a non-enemy character asks you to heal them, or asks you for help and you 
can tell they have taken damage or drain or suffer from a disease or poison, you 
must help them on your next turn. If they have a condition or suffer from a 
poison or disease that you can neutralize or cure ith any ability you possess or 
any spell you can cast, you must do so as your next action. Otherwise, if they 
have taken any damage, you must cast a spell or use an ability that heals hit 
points. Also, you cannot perform a coup de grace. 
You gain the ability to lay on hands, as the paladin ability, using your curse 
level (1/2 character level) as your paladin 
level.
- At 5th curse level, you gain a mercy, as the paladin ability.
- At 10th curse level, you gain a second mercy, and can exchange your first mercy for a different one.
- At 15th curse level, you gain a third mercy, and can exchange one of your existing mercies for a different one.
#### Lay on Hands (Merciful)
You may cure wounds with a touch 3 (1/4 character level + CHA mod) times per day, 
healing 1d6 (1d6 / 4 character levels, min 1d6) damage. This is a standard 
action when used on another target, or a swift action when used on yourself. 
### Healer's Touch (1st Antihero)
After curing a cumulative total of 1000 points of damage, plus 2 for every point 
of damage dealt, your healing spells always restores their maximum possible 
hitpoints when used on a target other than yourself. 
### Tantric Magic (3rd)
You can turn the energy of physical intimacy into mystic energy able to fuel 
your spells. This takes 15 minutes per spell-point restored and requires 
uninterrupted concentration. You may restore spell-points from any spell-point 
pool, but may not restore points from your open pool until your reserve pool is 
full. You cannot restore more spell-points per day that half your caster level 
or your Charisma bonus, whichever is higher, and cannot increase any spell-point 
pool to above its normal maximum.
Successfully restoring spell-points requires you make both a Charisma check (to 
generate the right level of carnal energy) and Spellcraft check (to convert the 
generated energy into spell-points). The DCs for these checks is 15 + the number 
of spell-points to be restored. On a failed check no spell-points are regained. 
A GM may allow you to replace the Charisma check with an appropriate Perform or 
Profession check.
After attempting to use this feat to restore spell-points, whether you succeed 
or fail, you must wait before you can try again on the same day. After an hour 
you may make a Constitution check with a DC equal to the DC of your previous 
Tantric Magic effort (bonuses from the Endurance feat apply to this check.) If 
you succeed you may use the feat again, if you fail you must wait an hour and 
make another Constitution check. The DC of this check decreases by 1 for every 
hour that has passed since you last used the feat.
<!-- ### Torchbearer (5th)
Vercingetorix has reunited with you. This functions as per Leadership, but does
not grant any followers. At 8th level, this becomes Leadership.  -->
<!-- ### Mystic Healer (7th)
Add additional dice to any form of healing you generate. This starts as +1d4, 
increasing to 1d6 at 4th level, 2d6 at 7th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at
13th level.  -->
