## Patron Spells
## Cantrips - 
- Arcane Mark
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range touch
  - Effect one personal rune or mark, all of which must fit within 1 sq. ft.
  - Duration permanent
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist 
of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An 
arcane mark spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm 
to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a detect 
magic spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily 
understandable.
See invisibility, true seeing, a gem of seeing, or a robe of eyes likewise 
allows the user to see an invisible arcane mark. A read magic spell reveals the 
words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster 
or by an erase spell.
If an arcane mark is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in 
about a month.
Arcane mark must be cast on an object prior to casting instant summons on the 
same object (see that spell description for details).
- Detect Magic
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Component: V, S
  - Range 60 ft.
  - Area cone-shaped emanation
  - Duration concentration, up to 1 min./level (D)
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long 
you study a particular area or subject.
1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent 
aura.
3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures 
bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill 
checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per 
aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If 
the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties 
(see Spellcraft).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may 
distort or conceal weaker auras.
- Detect Poison
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target or Area one creature, one object, or a 5-ft. cube
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is 
poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 Wisdom check. 
A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check 
if the Wisdom check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the 
Wisdom check. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of 
common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
- Guidance
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range touch
  - Target creature touched
  - Duration 1 minute or until discharged
  - Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes
This spell imbues the subject with a touch of divine guidance. The creature gets 
a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. It 
must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which 
it applies.
- Mending
  - Casting Time 10 minutes
  - Components V, S
  - Range 10 ft.
  - Target one object of up to 1 lb./level
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw: Will negates (harmless, object); Spell Resistance: yes (harmless, object)
This spell repairs damaged objects, restoring 1d4 hit points to the object. If 
the object has the broken condition, this condition is removed if the object is 
restored to at least half its original hit points. All of the pieces of an 
object must be present for this spell to function. Magic items can be repaired 
by this spell, but you must have a caster level equal to or higher than that of 
the object. Magic items that are destroyed (at 0 hit points or less) can be 
repaired with this spell, but this spell does not restore their magic abilities. 
This spell does not affect creatures (including constructs). This spell has no 
effect on objects that have been warped or otherwise transmuted, but it can 
still repair damage done to such items.
- Message
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, F (a piece of copper wire)
  - Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
  - Targets one creature/level
  - Duration 10 min./level
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those nearby can hear 
these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point your finger at each 
creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered 
message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 
foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of 
wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight 
line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the 
subject, and the path’s entire length lies within the spell’s range. The 
creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell 
transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn’t transcend language barriers. To speak a 
message, you must mouth the words and whisper.
- Read Magic
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, F (a clear crystal or mineral prism)
  - Range personal
  - Target you
  - Duration 10 min./level
You can decipher magical inscriptions on objects – books, scrolls, weapons, and 
the like – that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not 
normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the 
case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you 
have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that 
particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at 
the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a 
glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with 
a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + 
spell level).
Read magic can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
- Spark
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V or S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Targets one Fine object
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw Fortitude negates (object); Spell Resistance yes (object)
You can make an unattended Fine flammable object catch on fire. This works as if 
you were using flint and steel except that you can use spark in any sort of 
weather and it takes much less time to actually ignite an object.
- Stabilize
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V,S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target one living creature
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw Will negates (harmless); Spell Resistance yes (harmless)
Upon casting this spell, you target a living creature that has –1 or fewer hit 
points. That creature is automatically stabilized and does not lose any further 
hit points. If the creature later takes damage, it continues dying normally.

## 1st Level
- Beguiling Gift (Enchantment 1)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, F (the object to be offered)
  - Range 5 ft.
  - Targets one creature
  - Duration 1 round
  - Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
You offer an object to an adjacent creature, and entice it into using or 
consuming the proffered item. If the target fails its Will save, it immediately 
takes the offered object, dropping an already held object if necessary. On its 
next turn, it consumes or dons the object, as appropriate for the item in 
question. For example, an apple would be eaten, a potion consumed, a ring put on 
a finger, and a sword wielded in a free hand. If the target is physically unable 
to accept the object, the spell fails. The subject is under no obligation to 
continue consuming or using the item once the spell’s duration has expired, 
although it may find a cursed item difficult to be rid of.
- Charm Person (Enchantment 1)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target one humanoid creature
  - Duration 1 hour/level
  - Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
This charm makes a humanoid creature regard you as its trusted friend and ally 
(treat the target’s attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being 
threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on 
its saving throw.
The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an 
automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. 
You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma 
check to convince it to do anything it wouldn’t ordinarily do. (Retries are not 
allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders,
but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act 
by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the 
spell. You must speak the person’s language to communicate your commands, or 
else be good at pantomiming.
- Cure Light Wounds (Conjuration 1)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range touch
  - Target creature touched
  - Duration instantaneous
  - Saving Throw Will half (harmless); see text; Spell Resistance yes (harmless); see text
When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that 
cures 1d8 points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead 
are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of 
curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply Spell Resistance, and can 
attempt a Will save to take half damage.
- Unnatural Lust (Enchantment 1)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
  - Target one creature
  - Duration 1 round
  - Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
Your target is filled with lust and desire for a single creature or object as 
designated by you at the time of casting. That creature or object must be within 
the spell’s range and perceivable by the target of the spell. The target is 
filled with the compulsion to rush to the subject of its lust and passionately 
kiss or caress that subject on its next turn, taking no other actions. If the 
target would not normally have lustful feelings toward the designated creature 
or object, it receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw.
- Urban Grace (Transmutation 1)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S
  - Range personal
  - Target you
  - Duration 1 minute/level
You become one with the city around you, allowing you to move more easily 
through its crowds and buildings. For the duration of this spell, your base land 
speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, it does not cost you 2 squares of 
movement to enter a square with crowds, though the crowd still provides cover to 
you. This ability does not allow you to enter the space of enemy creatures 
without making the appropriate Acrobatics check. In addition, you receive a +4 
circumstance bonus on Acrobatics checks made to move across uneven urban 
surfaces, such as roofs and broken pavement, and on Climb checks made to scale
walls and other artificial surfaces. Whenever you make an Acrobatics check to 
make a long jump between two buildings or artificial structures, you are always 
treated as if you had a running start, regardless of the actual distance 
traveled.

## 2nd Level
- Calm Emotions (Enchantment 1)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, DF
  - Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
  - Area creatures in a 20-ft.-radius spread
  - Duration concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)
  - Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
This spell calms agitated creatures. You have no control over the affected 
creatures, but calm emotions can stop raging creatures from fighting or joyous 
ones from reveling. Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although 
they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action 
against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all 
calmed creatures.
This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses 
granted by spells such as bless, good hope, and rage, and also negates a bard’s 
ability to inspire courage or a barbarian’s rage ability. It also suppresses any 
fear effects and removes the confused condition from all targets. While the 
spell lasts, a suppressed spell, condition, or effect has no effect. When the 
calm emotions spell ends, the original spell or effect takes hold of the 
creature again, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.
- Raven's Flight (Transmutation 2)
  - Casting Time 1 swift action
  - Components V
  - Range personal
  - Target you
  - Duration 1 round
You can cast this spell only if it is the first action you take on your turn. In 
a burst of shadowy feathers, you turn into a Tiny blurred shape reminiscent of a 
black raven until the beginning of your next turn. You gain a fly speed of 50 
feet with good maneuverability, and apply appropriate size modifiers (though 
your ability scores don’t change). Until the beginning of your next turn, you 
can take only the 5-foot step, move, run, or withdraw actions. If the spell is 
dispelled while you are still aloft, the power of flight dissipates slowly; you 
float downward 60 feet on your next turn, then fall any remaining distance.
