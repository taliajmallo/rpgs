## Spell Words
### Targets
- Personal (Target 0)
  - Range no range
A wordspell with this target word only affects the caster. Effect words that are 
restricted to this word can be combined with other effect words, but the caster 
is the only target, regardless of other target possibilities.
- Selected (Target 0)
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
A wordspell with this target word affects a single target within range. If the 
wordspell deals energy damage, this word creates a ray that requires a ranged 
touch attack to hit, or it can be used as a melee touch attack with no range 
(decided by the wordcaster when the wordspell is cast). If it is used as a melee 
touch attack and the attack misses, the wordcaster can hold the charge and try 
again with subsequent attacks.
*Boost:* Instead of one target, the wordspell affects up to one target per 
caster level, no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. The range 
increases to medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./ level). If used with an effect word that 
deals energy damage, the wordcaster must make multiple ray attacks for each 
target (they cannot be made as melee touch attacks). This boosted target word 
increases the level of all the effect words in the spell by 3 levels.
- Cone (Target 0)
  - Range 10 ft.
A wordspell with this target word affects everything in a cone-shaped burst.
*Boost:* The range increases to 20 feet. Boosting this target word increases its 
level by 2.
*Boost:* The range increases to 40 feet. Boosting this target word increases its 
level by 4.
- Burst (Target 1)
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
A wordspell with this target word affects everything it catches in a 
10-foot-radius burst. Some effect words that use the burst target word are 
instead emanations, taking up the same area as the burst. These effect words 
typically have a longer duration and cannot be moved once created. They are 
noted by the word “emanation” in parentheses after the burst target restriction.
*Boost:* The spell affects everything in a 20-foot-radius burst. Its range 
increases to medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). Boosting this target word 
increases its level by 2.
*Boost:* The spell affects everything in a 40-foot-radius burst. Its range 
increases to long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level). Boosting this target word increases 
its level by 4.
- Line (Target 1)
  - Range 20 ft.
A wordspells with this target word affects everything in a 20-foot line.
*Boost:* The range increases to 60 feet. Boosting this target word increases its 
level by 1.
*Boost:* The range increases to 120 feet. Boosting this target word increases 
its level by 2.
- Arc (Target 2)
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
A wordspell with this target word affects a single creature within range, as 
well as a single secondary target within 20 feet of the primary target that is 
also in range. All effect words that deal damage do half damage to the secondary 
target, while effect words that do not deal damage grant the secondary target 
a +2 bonus to the appropriate saving throw. The arc target word cannot be the 
target word of a wordspell wherein any of its effect words are classified as 
harmless. All harmful effect words that are compatible with the selected target 
word are compatible with the arc target word; however, the arc target word 
increases the level of all effect words that are compatible with the selected 
target word by 1 level. 
*Boost:* The spell affects three targets. This tertiary target takes one quarter 
damage from effect words that deal damage and receives a +4 bonus to the 
appropriate saving throw against the effects of effect words that do not deal 
damage. This target word increases the level of all of the effect words in the 
spell by 2 levels.
*Boost:* Each of the targets of the spell creates a localized
explosion of the spell. Each target of the arc target word is
now the center of a 5 foot radius burst. This target word
increases the level of all of the effect words in the spell by
2 levels.
- Guardian (Target 2)
  - Special
A wordspell with this target word affects the caster, as well as a single 
willing individual within 10 feet of the caster. Should the two recipients of a 
wordspell with the guardian target word ever be more than 10 feet away from each 
other, the spell immediately ends for both individuals. All effect words that 
are compatible with the personal target word are compatible with the guardian 
target word; however, the guardian target word increases the level of all effect 
words that are compatible with the personal target word by 2 levels.
*Boost:* Should the two recipients of a wordspell with the guardian target word 
ever be more than 20 feet away from each other, the spell immediately ends for 
both individuals. They must still be within 10 feet for the initial casting. 
Boosting this target word increases its level by 2.
- Barrier (Target 3)
  - Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
A wordspell with this target word creates a visible barrier that is 10 feet long 
per caster level and 10 feet high. Creatures touching or passing through the 
barrier are subject to the spell’s effect. The barrier does not hinder creatures 
passing through it unless noted in the spell effect. Creatures occupying the 
space of the barrier when it forms are subject to the spell’s effect. The wall 
is 1 foot wide and must be anchored on a solid surface. The wall must be 
straight when formed.
*Boost:* The wall is 20 feet long per caster level and up to 20 feet high. The 
wall can take on any shape desired by the caster, but it must remain a vertical
surface.

### Meta
- Boost (Meta 0)
This meta word allows an effect or target word to use its boosted description. 
Some boosted descriptions increase the level of the effect word or target word, 
and can only be used if the wordspell is of a high enough level to accommodate 
the new level. If a word has more than one boosted description, the caster can 
choose which to use (but never more than one per word). This meta word can be 
applied to a spell multiple times—once to the target word and once for each 
effect word.
- Distant (Meta 0)
This word increases a wordspell’s range, as determined by its target word. If 
the word has a close range, it increases to medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level). If 
the word has a medium range, it increases to long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level). This 
word has no effect on target words with a range other than close or medium.
- Lengthy (Meta 0)
A wordspell with this meta word doubles its duration. This meta word has no 
affect on effect words with a duration of instantaneous. The effect of this word 
does not stack with the effect of the Extend Spell feat.
- Flexible (Meta 0)
This modifies a single effect word to allow it to use any target type, 
regardless of target restrictions. If using a Cone target, increase the level of 
the effect word by 1. If using a Burst or Line target, increase the level of the 
effect word by 2. If using a Barrier target, increase the level of the effect 
word by 3.

bleed damage. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 1.
- Cold Snap (Cold, Evocation 0)
  - Duration instantaneous

levels of the caster. Objects moved by this effect can be moved up to 15 feet 
per round and cannot be used to make attacks.
- Sense Magic (Detection, Divination 0)
  - Duration concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)
  - Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no
  - Target Restrictions cone
A wordspell with this effect word detects magic auras. By concentrating each 
round, the caster can determine the number and location of each aura in the 
area. He can make a Knowledge (arcana) skill check to determine the 
school of each aura (one check per aura, the DC of this check is 15 + the spell 
level or 15 + ½ the caster level for a nonspell effect). If the aura radiates 
from a magic item, the caster can attempt to identify the item’s properties as 
if using detect magic (see Spellcraft). If the aura emanates from a spell of 7th 
level or higher, or is a nonspell effect with a caster level of 12th or higher, 
the caster knows that the aura is strong, even if the Knowledge check to 
identify the school is unsuccessful.

- Friendship (Command, Enchantment 1)
  - Duration 10 minutes/level

The target of a wordspell with this effect word treats the caster as a trusted 
ally. The creature will defend the caster and will not attack the caster’s 
allies while the wordspell persists. If the creature is attacked by the caster 
or his allies, this effect immediately ends (though other effects of the 
wordspell may continue). A wordspell with this effect word only affects 
creatures of the humanoid type; targets receive a +4 bonus on the saving throw 
if a wordspell with the effect word has its target boosted to affect more than 
one creature.

  - Duration 1 round
  - Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
  - Target Restrictions Selected
The target of a wordspell with this effect word must follow one of five simple 
commands to the best of its ability on its next turn. If the target cannot take 
the specified action on its next turn, this effect of the wordspell fails. The 
possible commands are as follows.
**Approach**: The target must move toward the caster as quickly and directly as 
possible, provoking attacks of opportunity as normal. The target avoids obvious 
hazards, such as fire, pits, or traps that it is aware of (other creatures do 
not count).
**Drop**: The target drops whatever it is holding and does not pick up anything 
this round. It otherwise acts normally.
**Fall**: The target falls to the ground and remains prone until its next turn. 
It can otherwise act normally.
**Flee**: The target moves away from the caster as quickly and directly as 
possible. This otherwise functions as approach.
**Halt**: The target does not move and takes no other action on its turn, 
although it is not considered flat-footed or helpless.
*Boost:* This wordspell can use any target word. Boosting this effect word 
increases its level by 3.
- Wrack (Pain, Necromancy 1)
  - Duration 1 round/level
  - Saving Throw Fortitude negates; Spell Resistance yes

### Level 2 Effects
- Entangling Strands (Weather, Conjuration 2)
  - Duration 1 round/level

  - Range touch
  - Target creature touched
  - Duration 1 round/level
  - Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance no
Any opponent attempting to directly attack the warded creature, even with a 
targeted spell, must attempt a Will save. If the save succeeds, the opponent can 
attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save 
fails, the opponent can’t follow through with the attack, that part of its 
action is lost, and it can’t directly attack the warded creature for the
duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain 
unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked 
or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act.
- Touch of Mercy (Enchantment 2)
  - Casting Time 1 standard action
  - Components V, S, DF
  - Range touch
  - Target one creature
  - Duration 1 round/level (D)
  - Saving Throw Will negates; Spell Resistance yes
The target creature deals only nonlethal damage with all of its weapon attacks. 
Damage taken by creatures or objects that are not subject to nonlethal damage is 
not converted to nonlethal and remains lethal damage. The weapon retains all of 
its other normal properties.
