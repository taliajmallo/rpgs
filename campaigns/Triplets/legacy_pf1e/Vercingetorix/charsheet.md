## Traits & Drawbacks
### Overprotective (Drawback) 
If one of your allies should fall unconscious from hit point damage, you take a 
â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and skill checks as long as you are farther than 10 
feet away from your fallen ally.
### Contagious Mettle (Social)
You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves against fear. In addition, any allies 
adjacent to you receive a +1 morale bonus on Will saves against fear.
### Defender of the Society (Combat)
You gain a +1 trait bonus to Armor Class when wearing medium or heavy armor.
### On Guard (Regional)
You gain a +1 trait bonus to Initiative checks, and if you are able to act 
during the surprise round of an encounter, you can draw a weapon (but not a 
potion or magic item) as a free action during that round.

## Racial Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, you have a speed of 30 feet, and you have darkvision to a 
range of 60 feet. 
### City-Raised
You are proficient with whips and longswords, and receive a +2 racial bonus on 
Knowledge (local) checks.
### Orc Ferocity
Once per day, you are brought below 0 hit points but not killed, you can fight 
on for 1 more round as if disabled. At the end of your next turn, unless brought 
to above 0 hit points, you immediately fall unconscious and begin dying.
### Unflinching Valor
You gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against fear effects, and a +1 
racial bonus to CMD to avoid being grappled. 
### Favored Class: Armiger II
Every three times you select this option, grant DR 1/magic to any ally to whom 
you are giving a cover bonus. 

## Armiger Features
### Bulwark
You grant soft cover (+4 AC) to all adjacent allies. You must be conscious and 
able to take actions to grant this benefit. 
### Armiger Talent: Armor Training I
Armor you wear has its armor check penalty reduced by one, and its maximum 
dexterity bonus increased by one. 
### Reflect
You take half damage from any attack, spell, or ability that allows a Reflex 
saving throw. This stacks with any reduction from a successful save. 

## Feats 
### Torch Handling / Torch Fighter (1st)
You treat a torch as a light weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that 
of a light mace of its size plus 1 point of fire damage, and you do not incur 
penalties as you would for using it as an improvised weapon. The radius of 
normal and increased illumination shed by any torch or mundane light source you 
carry increases by 10 feet. Once per day you may reroll a single saving throw to 
resist any effect that would otherwise extinguish your light source, such as 
having water thrown at you, being targeted by a quench spell, and so on.
