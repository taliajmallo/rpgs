## Characteristics
### Nature of the Conniver
You regain willpower when you trick someone to serve your interests.

### Intimacies
Attempts to subvert an intimacy allow you to make a Willpower roll against
difficulty 8 to resist, even if you already failed to resist a supernatural
power. Once per session, when you act to strongly support or affirm one of your
intimacies, you may regain a point of willpower.
- Magic (Love)
- They will always discard you, so make yourself indispensable.
- ???

### Urge of the Corruptor
Replenish 2 motes whenever you destroy the illusions of the righteous, or tempt
them into abandoning their code and taking the low road. Additionally, regain
3 + Essence motes every sunrise.

### Limit
Gain limit when you botch a roll, undermine your nature or intimacies, or are
denounced by someone you respect or admire. Upon reaching 10 limit, reset your
limit meter to 0, and replace your Nature with a monstrous urge.

## Shintai Aspects
### Flight
You may fly at your normal movement speed, even outside Shintai form.

## Charms
Caste Hells: Kakuri, Wicked City
### Infernal
#### Crown of Flames
You become aware whenever someone speaks your name. You may optionally spend 1
mote to reflexively scry the situation without in any way impinging on your
concentration. You can see and hear the speaker and their surroundings for the
next Essence minutes, and amy optionally spend 1 additional mote to punish the
speaker with emerald flames (two lethal damage per turn of exposure, difficult
6 to soak). While your anima banner is flaring, there is no mote cost to any of
this.

#### Keys to the Kingdom I
When rolling a caste ability, you may reflexively spend 1 mote to add to your
die pool (Attribute + Ability) for Essence + 1 turns in combat / minutes out of
combat.

### Kakuri: The Night Realm
#### False Springs Beckon III
Extend your hand, and spend 1 mote. The target gains some temporary reprieve
from an ongoing malady or misery of theirs. This lasts for a number of weeks
equal to your Essence, ending early if they disobey a command of yours.

### Lanka: Demon City of the Rakshas
#### Prince of Ruin Attitude I
When attempting to use a broken or nonfunctional tool, object, or vehicle, you
may make a reflexive Appearance + Technology roll against difficulty 6. For the
rest of the scene, success forces the target to function as though new and whole.

### The Wicked City
#### Electronic Devil Caress II
You may operate any electronic device within (Essence x 5) yards without
touching it. If it is actively in the possession of another, you must roll
Intelligence + Technology against the target's Willpower. Alternatively, you can
spend 1 mote or 1 Willpower to short out the device and brick it.

#### Hollow Mind Possession II
You may focus on a computerized device within line of sight, spend 1 mote, and
roll Charisma + (higher of Computer or Technology) against difficulty 7.
Successes briefly awaken the spirit of the technology, and enslave it to your
will. It lasts a duration based on the successes rolled:
- 1: One day
- 2: One week
- 3: One month
- 4: One year
- 5+: Permanent

## Hedge Magic

difficulty is equal to 4 + the Path rank, and requires a number of successes

reduced.
