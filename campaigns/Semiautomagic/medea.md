## Characteristics
### Nature of the Show-Off
You regain willpower when your actions earn you praise from another.

### Intimacies
Attempts to subvert an intimacy allow you to make a Willpower roll against
difficulty 8 to resist, even if you already failed to resist a supernatural
power. Once per session, when you act to strongly support or affirm one of your
intimacies, you may regain a point of willpower.
- Magic (Love)
- Camila (She Can't Abandon Me)
- Always be the one holding the leash.

### Urge of the Corruptor
Replenish 2 motes whenever you destroy the illusions of the righteous, or tempt
them into abandoning their code and taking the low road. Additionally, regain
3 + Essence motes every sunrise.

### Limit
Gain limit when you botch a roll, undermine your nature or intimacies, or are
denounced by someone you respect or admire. Upon reaching 10 limit, reset your
limit meter to 0, and replace your Nature with a monstrous urge.

## Shintai Aspects
### Flight
You may fly at your normal movement speed, even outside Shintai form.

## Charms
Caste Hells: Kakuri, Wicked City

### Crown of Kings (Anima)
You may spend 1 mote to sanctify any oath you have personally witnessed. Any who
break this oath begin to radiate corrupt essence that draws in great swarms of
powerful, wicked spirits that desire nothing more than to feast on the
oathbreaker and everything she spends a great deal of time in contact with.
Additionally, if you approach any of the night folk on legitimate business and
they offer you or your companions unprovoked violence, then any roll made by the
offending supernatural during that violence which produces even a single 1
becomes an automatic botch.

### Keys to the Kingdom (Infernal I)
When rolling a caste ability, you may reflexively spend 1 mote to add to your
die pool (Attribute + Ability) for Essence + 1 turns in combat / minutes out of
combat.

### False Springs Beckon (Kakuri III)
Extend your hand, and spend 1 mote. The target gains some temporary reprieve
from an ongoing malady or misery of theirs. This lasts for a number of weeks
equal to your Essence, ending early if they disobey a command of yours.

### Electronic Devil Caress (Wicked City II)
You may operate any electronic device within (Essence x 5) yards without
touching it. If it is actively in the possession of another, you must roll
Intelligence + Technology against the target's Willpower. Alternatively, you can
spend 1 mote or 1 Willpower to short out the device and brick it.

### Hollow Mind Possession (Wicked City II)
You may focus on a computerized device within line of sight, spend 1 mote, and
roll Charisma + (higher of Computer or Technology) against difficulty 7.
Successes briefly awaken the spirit of the technology, and enslave it to your
will. It lasts a duration based on the successes rolled:
- 1: One day
- 2: One week
- 3: One month
- 4: One year
- 5+: Permanent

## Sorceries
### Iron Shade Binding
This hour-long ritual must be performed at night or in the Underworld, and uses
a ghost's living name, a piece of their body, or one of their fetters to summon
them and bind them to your service. Spend 5 motes and make an extended
Intelligence + Occult roll against difficulty 8. Once you reach ten successes,
the ghost is summoned to your ritual circle. Make contested Willpower rolls at
difficulty 6 against the ghost until you or it has three more successes than the
other. If the wraith wins, it may depart and is immune to this spell for an hour
and a day. Should you win, the wraith must obey your commands to the best of its
ability for a year and a day.

### Raise the Skeletal Horde
Raise one zombie per 2 motes spent on this spell, targeting existing cadavers.
Make an extended Intelligence + Occult roll against difficulty 8. Once you reach
10 successes, the dead rise at your command. Zombies are perfectly obedient, but
can only carry out simple instructions. They last for one cycle of the moon
unless within a Dragon Nest, in which case they last until destroyed.
#### Zombie Stats
Zombies have Strength 3, Dexterity 2, Stamina 4, Intelligence 1, and Brawl 2.
They always act last in a turn. They have Willpower 10, but cannot spend it;
they have 10 health levels and suffer no wound penalties. They halve any bashing
damage post-soak (round down), and suffer aggravated damage from fire. They can
soak lethal, but not aggravated, and can never heal. They are mindless, and can
only be controlled by effects that specifically command the mindless dead.
