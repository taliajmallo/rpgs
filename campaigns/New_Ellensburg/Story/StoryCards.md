## Main quests

### Priority: Grantt Mansion
- Prerequisites: None
- Expected Benefits: Value 10-15 payday per participant, story progress
- Actual Benefits: 
**Player Summary:** Jane, an information broker that works with the party, has a 
contact for a time-sensitive job with a big payout. Daniel Grantt, an Exogeni 
executive, has been called away on urgent business and left behind an unsecured
device containing sensitive information. The employer is offering a hefty reward
for acquiring Grantt's laptop, with a bonus if the job goes quietly. 
**Behind the Scenes:** Exogeni exec is joining the Coven, and is suspected to 
have made copies of planar research. The actual employer for this run is another
Exogeni executive who's more loyal to the company than Grantt. After the players
exfiltrate with the laptop, they're directed to meet with a contact at a local
cafe, and do the handoff there. However, the contact never makes it to the cafe, 
and the party is ambushed by TBD. 
#### Opportunity: Observe Security

bluff check. 
Result: Make a perception check. DC 5 to learn rough guard strength, DC 10 learn 
patrols and avoid them on heist, DC 15 notice guards don't act like normal hired 
security, DC 20 notice that guards are putting on a facade of calmness (as if 
there isn't anything going on here). 
#### Opportunity: Obtain Building Plans
Cost: Value 10 favor or value 10 bribe
Result: Map of the building, so players can avoid irrelevant rooms and not waste
time. DC 10 insight to recognize that map has some odd discrepancies, as if an

<!-- #### Opportunity: Janitor Uniforms

Result: All players have a uniform resembling the building janitorial staff's. 
They can walk right past most bystanders, though suspicious behavior will still

#### Opportunity: Maid's Key
Cost: Value 25 favor or value 20 bribe
Result: Gain a key to any low-security doors in the building. High-security 
doors, if they exist, will still need another method of opening.
