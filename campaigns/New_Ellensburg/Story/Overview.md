### New Ellensburg: City of Dreams
The city of New Ellensburg was founded approximately seventeen centuries ago 
atop a natural intersection of three major ley lines (and a constantly varying 
number of minor ones). The confluences of these ley lines thin planar boundaries 
between the prime material plane and the mirror fey plane, dramatically 
increasing ambient mana saturation and causing a variety of benign supernatural 
effects. The epithet "City of Dreams" is due to the most common of these: 
residents often share dreams with those nearby (and this effect alone has 
spawned several local industries, from dream tourism to "quiet sleep" charms).  
Due to the exceptional amount of ambient mana in and around the city, New 
Ellensburg has slowly become a global magnet for arcane arts, industries, and 
research over the last century or two. 

## Factions

research division is currently engaging in not-entirely-legal forays into using
extraplanar materials, which is only possible due to weak planar boundaries near
New Ellensburg's ley line confluences.
