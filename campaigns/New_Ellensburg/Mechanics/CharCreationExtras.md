# Character Creation Extras
## Wealth & Reputation
Roll 3d6, sum them, and split the points in any manner of your choice between 
Wealth and Reputation. You may not have a value lower than 1 in either. 
## Starting Items
Ignore any starting items from the D&D Player's Handbook. To purchase starting 
items, double your Wealth, purchase anything you like, and then halve your 
remaining Wealth afterwards. 
## Backgrounds
For character background, you may take any two skill/tool proficiencies, or any
one cantrip. If you choose a cantrip, choose the spellcasting modifier for one 
class that has that cantrip on their spell list. Use that modifier as your 
spellcasting modifier for that cantrip.
