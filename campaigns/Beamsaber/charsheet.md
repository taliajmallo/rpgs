## Physical Description
In human form, H-807F-3 closely resembles a human female of caucasian descent.
It stands at a height of 5'5", and consistently weighs 112.3 lbs without any of
the fluctuations due to diet or waste a human's weight will exhibit. It has
pale skin, brown hair, and brown eyes that match those of its human DNA donor.

When transformed, H-807F-3 has a four-armed humanoid torso roughly 17' in length,
atop a serpentine tail that stretches 83' in length. Its typical posture in this
form gives it an approximate standing height of 30', but it is capable of
rearing up to reach a functional height of 60' with as much exertion as a human
requires to stand on their toes. H-807F-3 does not have flesh in this form - its
body instead uses roughened muscle fibers studded with bone as its outermost
layer. Surgical experimentation has confirmed that it is possible to affix
vehicle-scale weaponry to the subject, as its nervous system carries a surplus
of electricity that can be used to power such implements.
