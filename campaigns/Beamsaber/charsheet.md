## Physical Description
In human form, H-807F-3 closely resembles a human female of caucasian descent.
It stands at a height of 5'5", and consistently weighs 112.3 lbs without any of
the fluctuations due to diet or waste a human's weight will exhibit. It has
pale skin, brown hair, and brown eyes that match those of its human DNA donor.

When transformed, H-807F-3 has a four-armed humanoid torso roughly 17' in length,
atop a serpentine tail that stretches 83' in length. Its typical posture in this
form gives it an approximate standing height of 30', but it is capable of
rearing up to reach a functional height of 60' with as much exertion as a human
requires to stand on their toes. H-807F-3 does not have flesh in this form - its
body instead uses roughened muscle fibers studded with bone as its outermost
layer. Surgical experimentation has confirmed that it is possible to affix
vehicle-scale weaponry to the subject, as its nervous system carries a surplus
of electricity that can be used to power such implements.

## Abilities
### Transform
Instead of a vehicle, you have an Other form. It uses the same rules as a
vehicle. To transform between Pilot and Other during a Mission, you must spend
one stress. Gain the scale and gear of each form.
### Veteran: Specialized Design (Scout)
You may use gear from the Scout playbook.
### Veteran: Internal Mechanism
Select a piece of Pilot or Vehicle Gear you have access to; a Pilot scale
version exists within your body. Reduce its Load by 1 (Minimum 0). It must be
declared at the start of every mission.

## Load (Light 3)
- (0) Internal Weaponry: Fine Directed Energy Weapon
- 3 Load Remaining

# Squad
## Beliefs
- Alvenica Midgard (Relena)
  - She is soft-hearted and will suffer for it.
  - She really cares, doesn't she?
- Amaryllis Ubiquitous (Minerva)
  - She understands purpose like I do, even if we serve different masters.
  - We are both weapons of war. How is it, then, that she so capably demonstrates agency away from the battlefield?
- Naomi Förstner (Caoimhe)
  - She is a dutiful and diligent interim handler - I am fortunate she survived.
  - She thinks I am going to kill her.
- Gawain 7490 (Satya)
  - She seemed surprised that I have a will of my own - is that how she used to see me? Is that how others see me?
