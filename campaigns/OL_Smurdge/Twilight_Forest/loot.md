# Loot

## Plant Encounter
One or two of the following: 
### Living Hide
As +1 Hide armor. Any time you take damage from a melee attack, you may use your
reaction and spend one of your hit dice to lash out with thorns. Roll the hit
die, and deal piercing damage equal to your roll. 
### Amulet of Thorny Embrace
Whenever you apply a condition that prevents a creature from moving, you may 
cause thorny vines to wrap around the target, dealing damage equal to your 
spellcasting modifier. 

## Cliffs Encounter
One or two of the following: 
### Unsettling Cloak
Any creature that starts its turn or moves within 5 feet of you must make a DC 
14 Wisdom save or become Frightened until the start of its next turn. 
### Glint of Shadows
As +1 dagger. While in dim light or darkness, you may spend a move action to 
teleport to location adjacent to another creature within 30 feet that is also
within dim light or darkness.  

## Hag Encounter
One or two of the following: 
### Dreamer's Eye
Sleeping creatures automatically fail any saving throws against Enchantment 
spells you cast, and have disadvantage on Wisdom, Intelligence, and Charisma 
saving throws against any spells you cast of other schools. 
### Jar of Winter's Breath
Once per day, you may release the Winter's Breath to freeze the surface of all 
exposed liquids in a 60 foot radius. Bloodied living creatures take 2d10 damage, 
and creatures made of liquids (such as water elementals) take 4d10 damage and 
are paralyzed for one minute. 

## Fey Reward
### Autumnal Blade
As +1 Sword of any type. After killing a living or undead creature with this 
weapon, you may spend a hit die to regain that much HP. 

## Hunter's Reward
### Fey-warped Crossbow
As +1 Heavy Crossbow. Instead of firing physical crossbow bolts, it fires 
illusory bolts that deal psychic damage. These bolts disappear immediately after
striking a target, and leave no physical evidence of a fired weapon behind.
