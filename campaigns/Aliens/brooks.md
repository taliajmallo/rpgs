## Talents
### Field Surgeon
You know the delicate art of stopping a wound from bleeding or treating grave
injuries. You get a +2 modification to MEDICAL AID when treating someone who is
about to die from a critical injury
### Menacing
You have a scary physical presence that makes it easy to intimidate people. You
can roll for Manipulation using Strength instead of Empathy when you threaten
someone to make them do what you want. If you succeed, your opponent cannot
demand anything in return from you. They can still choose to attack you instead
of giving in.
### Ether Junkie:
Due to repeated exposure to Ether, you find it difficult to resist taking more.
When you come into contact with any new ether pills, make a base wits check. If
you fail, you must immediately do your best to get a hold of and take another
pill if possible. You may try to be sneaky about it, but this goal takes
precedent over any other immediate plans.
Due to the effects of ether, your body is exceptionally strong but no longer
heals as well as it used to. In order to regain any health, you must first
complete a full uninterrupted 24 hours of rest.
