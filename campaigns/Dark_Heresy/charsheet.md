## Talents
### Melee Weapon Training (Primitive)
You may use primitive melee weapons without penalty.
### Basic Weapon Training (Las)
You may use las weapons without penalty.
### Pistol Training (Las)
You may use las pistols without penalty.
### Binary Chatter
You are adept at controlling servitors. Gain a +10 bonus to any attempt to instruct, program or question servitors.
### Total Recall
Through long years of mental conditioning and practice, your mind is like an archive, able to record and recall great amounts of information. You can automatically remember any trivial fact or piece of information that you might feasibly have picked up in the past. When trying to recall more detailed or obscure facts, such as the precise layout of a crime scene or a page you read in an ancient grimoire five years ago, the GM may require you to make an Intelligence Test.
### Electro Graft Use
You have the ability to use an electro graft to access data points and commune with machine spirits. This grants you a +10 bonus to Common Lore, Inquiry or Tech-Use Tests whilst connected to a data point.
### Technical Knock
With a honeyed whisper and ritual motion, you can awaken sleeping gun-spirits into furious action once more. You may unjam any gun as a Half Action. You must touch the gun in question to enact this rite. You may only perform this rite on one weapon per Round—any more would be disrespectful.


## Traits
### "Truth is Subjective" Divination
Effect: Increase Intelligence by +3. Begin play with 3 Corruption Points.
### Mechanicus Implants
Over the course of many complicated rituals, you have been blessed and purified. You have been judged a suitable vessel for the following implants:
Electro-Graft: This is a small port that is grafted into your nervous system. Once you have been properly trained, this will allow you to interface with machine data ports, and certain types of data nets. Electro-grafts can take many forms, such as electoos, skull shunts, finger probes or spine jacks.
Electoo Inductors: These are palm-sized metal skin grafts that appear much like tattoos to the uninitiated. The electoos are wired into your nervous system, where they derive power from the bio-electrical emanations of the flesh. They can be used to emit or siphon power in many ways. Electoo inductors can be any colour, and can appear anywhere on the body—though hands or mechadendrites are the usual sites.
Respirator Unit: This implant covers the lower half of your face with a network of grilles and tubing. It purifies your air supply, granting a +20% bonus to resist airborne toxins and gas weapons. The respirator unit also contains a vox-synthesiser capable of transmitting your voice in a variety of ways. Respirators can appear as simple grille units or intricate mask-like carvings.
Cyber-Mantle: This is a framework of metal, wires and impulse transmitters that is bolted on to your spine and lower ribcage. As you gain further implants, this mantle will act as a sub-dermal anchorage point. Amongst some servants of the Omnissiah, this cyber-mantle is often referred to as 'the true flesh'. One would have to look beneath the red robes of a Tech-Priest to discover what a cyber-mantle looks like, and thus no one admits to having seen one.
Potentia Coil: Cradled within the cyber-mantle is a power unit known as the potentia coil. This mass can store energy and produce various types of fields. Coils come in many types, from small crystal stack affairs, to bulky electrical galvinators salvaged from vehicle engines. Many a hunchback within the Adeptus Mechanicus is blamed upon a primitive coil.
Cranial Circuitry: This is a series of linked processors, implants and cortical circuits that augments your mental capacities. Most sit within housing bolted onto the skull, whilst others nestle within the brain itself. As you grow in the seriousness of your devotions, more and more of the brain that deals with useless things such as emotion and intuition can be scooped away to provide room for additional augmentations. Cranial circuits are often very crude-looking, and frequently rather aged.
### Fit For Purpose
A forge world inhabitant is repeatedly tested, channelled and trained from birth for their chosen station and role in life. Weakness is not tolerated and failure met with painful incentives to do better. Even those who follow a rogue's path must strive to be better than their peers to survive.
Effect: Gain +3 Willpower.
### Stranger to the Cult
Although forge world born citizens know that the Emperor is their god and saviour, they see the Imperial Creed through the lens of Cult Mechanicus doctrine. As a result, they can be surprisingly—and sometimes dangerously—ignorant of the common teachings and practices of the Ecclesiarchy, often failing to offer its clerics the level of deference they expect.
Effect: Forge world characters take a -10 penalty on Tests involving knowledge of the Imperial Creed, and a -5 penalty on Fellowship Tests to interact with members of the Ecclesiarchy in formal settings.
### Credo Omnissiah
Rather than being fully indoctrinated into the Imperial Cult, even the lowliest member of a forge world's society is brought up to venerate the spirits of the machine and to know and trust the basic rites of tech-propitiation.
Effect: You gain the Technical Knock talent.
### Cog in the Grand Machine Background Package
Reduce starting Weapon Skill and Fellowship each by -5. You gain Literacy, Logic, Psyniscience, Scholastic Lore (Archaic), and Scholastic Lore (Bureaucracy) as bonus Skills. You gain Total Recall and Binary Chatter as bonus Talents.
