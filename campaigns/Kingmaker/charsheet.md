### Group Impression (Background)
[General] [Skill]
When you Make an Impression, you can compare your Diplomacy check result to the
Will DCs of two targets instead of one. It's possible to get a different degree
of success for each target. The number of targets increases to four if you're an
expert, 10 if you're a master, and 25 if you're legendary.

## Ancestry - Elven Ardande
### Elf
Your size is medium, and you have low-light vision. You can see in dim light as
if it were bright light. Your movement speed is 30 feet.

### Ardande
You can see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can see in bright
light, though your vision in darkness is in black and white.

### Otherworldly Magic (1st Ancestry)
[Elf]
You gain a single cantrip from the Arcane tradition.

#### Prestidigitation (Innate Cantrip)
[Cantrip] [Evocation] [Verbal] [Somatic] [>>]
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
Duration sustained
The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for
as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can
choose one of four options. Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse
conditions.
- Cook: Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
- Lift: Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the
  ground.
- Make: Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical
  substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile - it
  can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
- Tidy: Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an
  object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1
  minute per Bulk.

## Background - Brevic Noble (Orlovsky)
You claim a tangential but legitimate connection to one of Brevoy's noble
families - house Orlovsky. Your family has a reputation for avoiding conflicts,
and the family motto is "High Above". You're trained in Diplomacy and Brevoy
Lore, and gain the Group Impression skill feat.

### Languages
Elven, Hallit, Taldane

## Class - Kineticist

### Kinetic Gate (1st Feature)
You have a single gate to the plane of Wood.

### Wood Junction (1st Feature)
When you use a wood impulse that takes 2 or more actions, you may choose to gain
temporary hitpoints equal to your level that last until the start of your next
turn.

### Kinetic Aura (1st Feature)
Upon channeling an element, you gain a 10' kinetic aura. Kineticist stances
affect creatures within this aura.

#### Channel Elements
[Aura] [Kineticist] [Primal] [Wood] [>]
You tap into your kinetic gate to make elements flow around you. Your kinetic
aura activates, and as a part of this action, you can use a 1-action Elemental
Blast or a 1-action stance impulse. Your kinetic aura is a 10-foot emanation,
and deactivates if you are knocked out, Dismiss the aura, or use an impulse with
the Overflow trait.

### Elemental Blast (1st Feature)
[Attack] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Primal] [Wood] [>->>]
Make a melee or ranged impulse attack against the AC of a creature within 30',
dealing 1d8 bludgeoning or vitality (your choice) damage on a hit, double damage
on a critical. If you make a 2-action elemental blast, you gain a status bonus
to the damage roll equal to your Constitution modifier.
*Level (+4)* The damage increases by one die.

### Base Kinesis (1st Feature)
[Impulse] [Kineticist] [Primal] [Wood] [>>]
You may create ordinary elemental wood, move unattended wood objects of light or
negligible bulk within 30', or destroy unworked nonmagical wood within 30'.
*Level (+4)* The range increases by 15', and the maximum Bulk increases by 1.

### Elemental Familiar (1st Feat)
[Kineticist]
You gain a kinetic familiar.

### Fresh Produce (1st Gate Impulse)
[Healing] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Plant] [Primal] [Vitality] [Wood] [>]
You grow a nourishing nut, vegetable, seed, or fruit. Choose a creature in your
kinetic aura. The produce grows in their open hand, or at their feet if they
have no open hands. The produce has light Bulk. A creature can eat it with an
Interact action to regain 1d4 + 1 HP; this is a healing vitality effect. The
creature feels full for 10 minutes, during which it has resistance 2 to void
damage and can't eat another piece of produce. Produce not consumed by the start
of your next turn withers away.
*Level (+2)* The healing increases by 1d4+5, and the resistance increases by 2.

### Timber Sentinel (1st Gate Impulse)
[Impulse] [Kineticist] [Plant] [Primal] [Wood] [>>]
A slim, symmetrical tree travels from the Plane of Wood. You conjure a tree
within 30 feet that has AC 10 and 10 hitpoints. Whenever an ally adjacent to the
tree is hit by a Strike, the tree interposes its branches and takes the damage
first. Any additional damage beyond what it takes to reduce the tree to 0
hitpoints is dealt to the original target. The tree isn't large enough to impede
movement through its square. Using this impulse again ends any previous use,
leaving behind an ordinary tree if used in a space where a tree can live.
*Level (+2)* The tree has an additional 10 hitpoints.

## Familiar
Your familiar resembles a tiny stoat carved out of wood. It has the minion trait,
and so gain 2 actions in a round if and only if you use an action to command
them. It has a movement speed of 25'. Its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth
modifiers are all equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier.
### Lifelink
If your familiar would be reduced to 0 HP by damage, as a reaction with the
concentrate trait, you can take the damage. If you do, you take all the damage
and your familiar takes none. However, special effects that would occur due to
that damage (such as snake venom) still apply to your familiar.
### Share Senses
Once every 10 minutes, you can use a single action with the concentrate trait to
project your senses into your familiar. When you do, you lose all sensory
information from your own body, but can sense through your familiar's body for
up to 1 minute. You can Dismiss this effect.
