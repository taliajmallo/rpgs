### Arcane Sense (2nd Skill)
[General] [Skill]
You can cast 1st-level detect magic at-will as an arcane innate spell. If you're
a master in arcana, this heightens to 3rd; if legendary, this heightens to 4th.

#### Detect Magic (Cantrip I)
[Arcane] [Cantrip] [Detection] [Divination] [Somatic] [Verbal] [>>]
*Area* 30' emanation
You send out a pulse that registers the presence of magic. You receive no
information beyond the presence or absence of magic. You can choose to ignore
magic you're fully aware of, such as the magic items and ongoing spells of you
and your allies.
You detect illusion magic only if that magic's effect has a lower level than the
level of your detect magic spell. However, items that have an illusion aura but
aren't deceptive in appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are
detected normally.

## Ancestry - Elven Ardande

### Elf
Your size is medium, and you have low-light vision. You can see in dim light as
if it were bright light. Your movement speed is 30 feet.

### Ardande
You can see in darkness and dim light just as well as you can see in bright
light, though your vision in darkness is in black and white.

### Otherworldly Magic (1st Ancestry)
[Elf]
You gain a single cantrip from the Arcane tradition.

#### Prestidigitation (Innate Cantrip)
[Cantrip] [Evocation] [Verbal] [Somatic] [>>]
Range 10 feet; Targets 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)
Duration sustained
The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for
as long as you Sustain the Spell. Each time you Sustain the Spell, you can
choose one of four options. Prestidigitation can't deal damage or cause adverse
conditions.
- Cook: Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
- Lift: Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the
  ground.
- Make: Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical
  substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile - it
  can't be used as a tool, weapon, or spell component.
- Tidy: Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an
  object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object a 1
  minute per Bulk.

## Background - Anti-Magical
Magic has never worked quite right around you. Perhaps you have become a 
magic-user in spite of that, or perhaps you use your unique ability to fight 
magic-users.
You're trained in a Lore skill of your choice, though it can't be about a 
magical subject (as determined by the GM if it's unclear). Whenever you would be 
affected by magic, even your own magic or that of an ally, the originator of the 
effect must attempt a DC 3 flat check. On a failure, the magic doesn't affect 
you (though it still has its normal effects on anyone else). On a success, the 
magic affects you and there is no need to attempt further flat checks for the 
same magical effect, even if it affects you again later.

### Automatic Bonus Progression
- 2nd: +1 to weapon & unarmed attack rolls
- 3rd: +1 to impulse attack rolls

### Canny Acumen (3rd General)
Become an expert in Perception. At 17th level, you become a master instead.

### Languages
Elven, Hallit, Taldane

## Class - Kineticist

### Kinetic Gate (1st Feature)
You have a dual gate to the planes of Wood and Water.

### Kinetic Aura (1st Feature)
Upon channeling an element, you gain a 10' kinetic aura. Kineticist stances
affect creatures within this aura.

#### Channel Elements
[Aura] [Kineticist] [Primal] [Wood] [>]
You tap into your kinetic gate to make elements flow around you. Your kinetic
aura activates, and as a part of this action, you can use a 1-action Elemental
Blast or a 1-action stance impulse. Your kinetic aura is a 10-foot emanation,
and deactivates if you are knocked out, Dismiss the aura, or use an impulse with
the Overflow trait.

### Elemental Blast (1st Feature)
[Attack] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Primal] [Wood] [>->>]
Make a melee or ranged impulse attack against the AC of a creature within 30',
dealing 1d8 bludgeoning, cold, or vitality (your choice) damage on a hit, double
damage on a critical. If you make a 2-action elemental blast, you gain a status
bonus to the damage roll equal to your Constitution modifier.
*Level (+4)* The damage increases by one die.

### Base Kinesis (1st Feature)
[Impulse] [Kineticist] [Primal] [Wood] [>>]
You may affect wood or water. This has a range of 30', and the bulk of the
the target must be negligible or light. The target cannot be magical, secured in
place, or attended by a creature unwilling to let you. Choose one:
- Generate: Bring ordinary water or wood from its elemental plane.
- Move: Move water or wood 20' in any direction. You can catch it if it enters
  your space, and sustain this impulse to keep moving it.
- Suppress: Destroy existing, natural water or wood.
*Level (+4)* The range increases by 15', and the maximum Bulk increases by 1.

### Fresh Produce (1st Feat)
[Healing] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Plant] [Primal] [Vitality] [Wood] [>]
You grow a nourishing nut, vegetable, seed, or fruit. Choose a creature in your
kinetic aura. The produce grows in their open hand, or at their feet if they
have no open hands. The produce has light Bulk. A creature can eat it with an
Interact action to regain 1d4 + 1 HP; this is a healing vitality effect. The
creature feels full for 10 minutes, during which it has resistance 2 to void
damage and can't eat another piece of produce. Produce not consumed by the start
of your next turn withers away.
*Level (+2)* The healing increases by 1d4+5, and the resistance increases by 2.

### Timber Sentinel (1st Gate Impulse)
[Impulse] [Kineticist] [Plant] [Primal] [Wood] [>>]
A slim, symmetrical tree travels from the Plane of Wood. You conjure a tree
within 30 feet that has AC 10 and 10 hitpoints. Whenever an ally adjacent to the
tree is hit by a Strike, the tree interposes its branches and takes the damage
first. Any additional damage beyond what it takes to reduce the tree to 0
hitpoints is dealt to the original target. The tree isn't large enough to impede
movement through its square. Using this impulse again ends any previous use,
leaving behind an ordinary tree if used in a space where a tree can live.
*Level (+2)* The tree has an additional 10 hitpoints.

### Winter's Clutch (1st Gate Impulse)
[Cold] [Impulse] [Kineticist] [Primal] [Water] [>>]
Gleaming flakes of chilling snow fall in a 10-foot burst within 60 feet. Each 
creature in the area takes 2d4 cold damage with a basic Reflex save against your 
class DC. The ground in the area is covered in a snow drift, which is difficult 
terrain. Each square of the drift lasts until it melts, either naturally or 
until fire damage is dealt in that square.
*Level (+2)* The damage increases by 1d4.

### Hail of Splinters (2nd Feat)
[Impulse] [Kineticist] [Overflow] [Primal] [Wood] [>>]
A fusillade of jagged splinters flies from you. Creatures in a 30-foot cone take
1d4 piercing damage and 1d4 persistent bleed damage with a basic Reflex save
against your class DC.
*Level (+2)* Each type of damage increases by 1d4.

### Cavalier Dedication (2nd Archetype)
[Archetype] [Dedication]
You gain a young animal companion that serves as your mount.

## Animal Companion
Your animal companion is a horse. Its size is large, and its speed is 40'. It
has low-light vision and 30' imprecise scent. Its strike is a single action with
the agile trait, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning.
