## The Anomalous
- Exalts are referred to as "anomalous" (yes, as a noun)
- Classified by anima colors
### Gold-Type Anomalous
- Solars are all gold-types
#### Gold-??? (Dawn)
The Caste Mark of the Dawn is an eightpointed sunburst of purest gold, gleaming on the brow.
Dawn Caste anima banners are often pale gold or white,
tinged with rose red and subtle violet hues—the colors of
the sunrise.
#### Gold-White (Zenith)
A Zenith Caste Mark is a brilliant golden
circle, shining like the noonday sun on the brow. Zenith
anima banners are bonfires of bright white and majestic
gold.
#### Gold-??? (Twilight)
The Twilight Caste Mark is a golden circle
on the brow, filled in on top with the bottom half empty.
Twilight animas are a splendid riot of evening colors, encompassing bright golds and reds, as well as subdued blues
and violet hues.
#### Gold-??? (Night)
A Night’s Caste Mark is an empty golden
circle on the brow. Night Caste animas are pale gold with
hues of ghostly white, soft violet, and luminous grey.
#### Gold-??? (Eclipse)
The Eclipse Caste Mark is a disk within
a circle, both of brilliant gold. Their animas resemble the
corona of the sun during an eclipse—brilliant whites and
golds, sparkling at the core and growing filmy and diaphanous at the edges.
### Black-Type Anomalous
#### Black-???
The black of Dusk Caste animas may also feature traces of dark greys or purples, or blood red.
#### Black-??? (Midnight)
Midnight Caste animas are usually pure black, but may sometimes have faint tinges of darkest blue.
#### Black-??? (Daybreak)
Daybreak animas typically include dull blue and orange as well as black.
#### Black-White (Day)
Day Caste animas display a monochromatic range of black to pale grey, occasionally going as far as faded white in the brightest spots.
#### Black-??? (Moonshadow)
A Moonshadow anima is black sparkling with faint grey, green and purple lights.
