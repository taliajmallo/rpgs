## Sister-in-Arms Standardbearer
### Edict of the Scarlet Rose
You must remain loyal to your allies and always work to further the aims of the 
group. You must protect your allies from harm, and defend their honor when 
called into doubt. If you fail at these edicts, you may not challenge foes for
24 hours. 
### Challenge
Once per day, you may challenge a foe as a swift action. You deal extra damage
on melee attacks against the target equal to 1/2 your level (minimum 1), and 
gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against attacks made by the target, but suffer 
a -2 penalty to AC against all attacks not made by the target of your challenge. 
Allies also gain a +1 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls against the 
target whenever you are threatening the target. 
The bonuses to AC and allies' attack rolls increase by +1 at 4th level and every
four levels thereafter, and you gain an additional use per day of this ability 
every three levels after 1st. 
### Skills of the Order

or to protect allies against harsh weather equal to 1/2 your level (minimum 1)
and may attempt Knowledge (Nobility) checks untrained.

All allies within 60 feet who can clearly see your standard gain a +2 morale
bonus to CMD and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls to creatures threatening an
ally. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonus to CMD increases by
+1. 
### Tactician
Once per day as a standard action, you may grant use of the following teamwork 
feats to any allies within 30 feet, lasting for 3 rounds. 
#### Extend the Bulwark
If you are wearing medium or heavy armor and are adjacent to an ally who also 
has this feat, as a free action, you may give your ally a circumstance bonus to 
her AC equal to half the armor bonus provided by your armor. This bonus lasts 
for 1 round. During this round, you gain no bonus to your AC from your armor.

## Fiend Keeper Features
### Evil Spirit
Rather than channel the spirits of dead heroes, you invoke aspects of a fragment
of a Devil Lord's soul that you have bound within you. Willingly performing an
evil act automatically grants any current spirit 1 point of influence over you.
Protection From Evil suppresses all of the spirit's benefits for the duration
of the spell. When your current spirit has at least 3 points of influence, in
addition to the penalties associated with it normally, you gain an evil aura as
per a cleric of your level, and you treat your alignment as evil for the 
purposes of resisting or being vulnerable to spells and abilities.  
### TODO

## Feats 
### Healer's Hands (1st)
You can use the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds as a full-round action. You do
not take a penalty for not using a healer’s kit when treating deadly wounds this 
way, and you can do so on a given creature more than once per day. When treating 
deadly wounds this way, if your result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, add your 
ranks in Knowledge (planes) to the damage healed. These benefits do not apply to 
creatures that are not healed by positive energy. You can use this feat’s 
benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes).
### Spiritual Training (Antihero 1st)
You gain a +2 competence bonus on Knowledge checks to identify creatures with 
the incorporeal subtype, and can attempt Knowledge checks dealing with 
incorporeal creatures untrained. When affected by a dominate person, magic jar, 
or possession spell or a similar ability, your mind and soul remain aware within 
your body, at war with the invading consciousness. While dominated or possessed, 
you can attempt a Will save as a swift action to temporarily regain control over 
your body. On a successful save, you can act normally for 1 round. On a failed 
save, you cannot attempt to regain control for 1 hour, but the possessing 
consciousness can’t take a swift action that round.
