# Blooded Aasimar (Monstrous Aasimar Subrace, 20RP)
While all aasimar have some trait that reveals their celestial heritage to 
onlookers, blooded aasimar are more conspicuous than most. Their unnerving eyes 
of solid black are said to see the auras of souls instead of light and color, 
and many have wings too large to hide underneath armor or a cloak (though they
typically are insufficient for flight).

## Basic Statistics
**Ability Score Modifiers:** Blooded aasimar have an unearthly grace, but often 
find it difficult to understand other mortals' behavior, and the strain of their 
inhuman features often leave them frail. They gain +4 to Charisma, but suffer 
a -2 penalty to Wisdom and Constitution. 

**Type:** Blooded aasimar are outsiders with the native subtype. 

**Base Speed:** Blooded aasimar have a base speed of 40 feet, as they use their
wings to assist with running. 

**Languages:** Aasimars begin play speaking Common and Celestial. Blooded 
aasimars with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following languages:
*TBD*

## Special Traits
**Soul-sight:** Blooded aasimar can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even 
that created by spells such as *deeper darkness*. In addition, they gain the use 
of *deathwatch* as a constant spell-like ability. However, they are completely 
colorblind, and automatically fail any checks that require discerning color. 
Knowledge (Planes) is always considered to be a class skill for blooded aasimar. 

**Wings:** Blooded aasimar take no damage from falling (as if subject to a 
constant nonmagical *feather fall* spell). While in midair, blooded aasimar may
move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot they fall, at a 
speed of 60 feet per round. Blooded aasimar may not gain height with these wings
alone, but gain a +4 to Fly checks if they become capable of flight through 
another method. Fly is always considered to be a class skill for blooded aasimar.
