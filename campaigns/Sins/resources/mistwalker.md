# Mistwalker Oracle Archetype
## Curse
Curse: A mistwalker is cursed with a unique affliction. Mists cloud her eyes, rendering her completely blind. She is denied her dexterity bonus to her AC, and automatically fails any check requiring vision. Furthermore, most enemies have full (50%) concealment against her. However, this blindness comes with supernatural powers. 

As a free action, a mistwalker may create or remove a mist shroud from herself. This effect creates an area of mist and fog centered around her with a radius of 15 feet. The mist is noticeable enough to seem out of place, but unless a person witnessed the mistwalker create it, it appears as natural (if strange). A mistwalker may control the thickness of the mist, to a lower limit of “just barely visible” to an upper limit of “thick fog”. This cannot grant concealment unless the Concealing Shroud revelation is taken. 

A mistwalker has supernatural senses that extend to anywhere her mist shroud touches. While her mist shroud is active, a mistwalker gains blindsense with a range equal to her mist shroud's radius, and may detect the current health of any creature within her mist shroud as if under the effects of the Deathwatch spell. If she possesses any spells or abilities that rely on sight, such as a gaze attack, she is considered to have sight to anywhere in her mist shroud. 
- At 5th level, a mistwalker may no longer be flanked by creatures within her mist shroud. In addition, the radius of her mist shroud increases to 20 feet. 
- At 10th level, while her mist shroud is active, a mistwalker increases miss chances against her granted from any concealment by 5%. In addition, the radius of her mist shroud increases to 25 feet. 
- At 15th level, while her mist shroud is active, a mistwalker gains blindsight with a range equal to her mist shroud's radius. In addition, the radius of her mist shroud increases to 30 feet. 

Mystery: A mistwalker pursues a unique mystery: that of the mist. 

Bonus Spells: You may gain either the corresponding Waves bonus spell or the corresponding Wind bonus spell for each level. You may have a maximum of Waves bonus spells equal to your Wind bonus spells plus one, and a maximum of Wind bonus spells equal to your Waves bonus spells plus one. Upon gaining a new bonus spell, you may trade a lower level bonus spell for its corresponding bonus spell of the other list. 

Bonus Class Skills: Diplomacy, Bluff, Stealth, and Disguise 

## Revelations

Aura Sight (Su): You detect auras within your mist shroud. Whenever her mist shroud is active, you may benefit from Detect Magic, Detect Good, Detect Evil, Detect Law, and Detect Chaos, but with a range equal to your mist shroud's radius, and you can be stunned by an overwhelming aura of any alignment (not just opposite your own). If you are stunned by an overwhelming aura, you cannot benefit from this revelation for 24 hours.

Concealing Shroud (Su): While your mist shroud is active, you gain concealment (20% miss chance) against all ranged attacks made with physical weapons. You may spend a swift action to suspend this effect on yourself and grant it to another creature within your mist shroud for one round. At 11th level, this grants concealment against all ranged attacks instead. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation. 

Thick Fog (Sp): You may create a thick fog, as per the spell Obscuring Mist, a number of times per day equal to 3 plus your Charisma modifier. 

Reaching Mists (Su): When using a spell or ability that grants a melee touch attack or requires touching a willing target, you may spend a move action to target a creature or object within your mist shroud instead. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation. 

Warding Winds (Su): You are attuned to the patterns of the winds and waters around you. Whenever you have your mist shroud active, add your Charisma modifier (instead of your Dexterity modifier) to your Armor Class and all Reflex saving throws. Your armor's maximum Dexterity bonus applies to your Charisma instead of your Dexterity. You do not lose this benefit when you would normally lose your Dexterity modifier, as your defense comes from supernatural means rather than superior reflex. 

Pierce the Veil (Su): As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of cold damage +1 point for every two mistwalker levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. At 11th level, your attacks and spells ignore the incorporeal property. 

Avoid Notice (Su): While your mist shroud is active, you may manipulate it to shrug off attention. Creatures not actively observing you stop consciously noticing your presence, and immediately forget you when you leave their presence. In conversations, they act as if you were not there. If directly reminded of your existence, such as by another pointing you out or you attacking them, this effect immediately ends. Creatures making an active effort to watch for people may make a Will saving throw. On a success, they are immune to this revelation for 24 hours. 

Silent Voice (Su): You may establish a telepathic rapport with a single other creature. Establishing a rapport takes 60 seconds of concentration by both individuals, and may not be done without the other’s consent. Rapports last until either individual decides to end them, and if you attempt to form a new rapport while the previous still lasts, the previous rapport is broken. Any benefits of the rapport have a maximum range of one mile per mistwalker level, but the rapport is not broken by exceeding that distance. Each of you may mentally communicate with each other, as though you were speaking to the other, and both of you gain a +2 morale bonus on any Aid Another attempts to help the other. 
At 7th level, while the target of your rapport is within your mist shroud, both members of the rapport may cast spells with a range of Personal on the other. Additionally, increase the benefits received from each other's successful Aid Another attempts by +2. 
At 11th level, while the target of your rapport is within your mist shroud, whenever either member of the rapport casts a spell with a range of Personal, the caster may choose to affect both members of the rapport. Additionally, both members of the rapport cannot roll less than 5 on attempts to aid the other. 
If the target of your rapport has a similar ability that grants benefits to a single creature, cannot simultaneously affect more than one creature, and has a duration of at least a day, they cannot target a creature other than you with that ability. An example of such an ability is the Divine Troth class feature of the Paladin archetype, Divine Guardian. If they grant you the benefits of that ability, both of you treat your class levels as one higher for determining the effects of this revelation and their similar ability. 

Revealing Mist (Su): You may use scrying instruments within your mist shroud as though you were capable of seeing them. At 7th level, you can use any calm pool of water at least 1 foot in diameter as a scrying device, as if using the scry spell. At 15th level, this functions like greater scrying. You can use the scrying abilities for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.

Blinding Mist (Su): Whenever a creature fails a saving throw and takes damage from one of your spells, it is blinded for 1 round. Spells that do not allow a save do not blind creatures. At 11th level, the duration increases to 1d4 rounds.

Final Revelation: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of the hidden mists. Any concealment you have from supernatural or spell-like effects is granted to all allies within your mist shroud, and once per turn as a free action you may render one creature within your mist shroud invisible for 6 seconds per mistwalker level or until they perform a hostile action. Finally, when below 0 hitpoints, you gain full (50%) concealment against all enemies.
