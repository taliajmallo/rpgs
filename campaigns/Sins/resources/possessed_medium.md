# Rules Variant: Possessed Medium
Normally, when a Medium becomes possessed, they become a NPC under DM control. 
Instead, consider allowing the following rules while possessed: 

## Possession
While your spirit has 5 or more influence, you are considered to be under the 
effects of a magical compulsion effect with a spell level equal to half your 
Medium level. Any spell or effect that would remove such a condition instead 
reduces your spirit's influence by a quarter of the caster's level, to a maximum
of your spirit's influence -4 (you cannot have your spirit's influence brought
below 4 by external sources). 
While under this compulsion effect, you are required to act in accordance with 
your spirit's wishes. The GM may, at any time, have the spirit issue a command 
that you must follow to the best of your ability. You may attempt a Will save 
(DC 10 + Current Influence) to ignore the command, but the spirit's influence 
increases by 1 afterwards regardless of whether you succeed or fail on your save. 

## Alignment
While your spirit has 5 or more influence, your alignment is temporarily changed
to the spirit's. 

## Class Features
While your spirit has 5 or more influence, you cannot intentionally use any 
class feature that would increase the spirit's influence, nor may you use the
Haunt Channeler, Location Channel, Connection Channel, Ask the Spirits, or 
Astral Journey class features. If you have an archetype that modifies or 
replaces these features, you may not use any feature that involves communicating
with a supernatural entity other than your current spirit.  

## Taboo
When using these rules, a spirit does not leave your body if breaking a taboo 
would bring its influence to 5 or more. If you have a taboo already when your 
spirit's influence reaches 5 or more, all numerical penalties for the taboo 
except for influence gain are increased by one. If you do not already have a 
taboo, you must accept one. 
While your spirit has 5 or more influence, repeatedly breaking a taboo causes
your spirit to gain 1 influence each time you break it, rather than just the 
first. 

## Influence Penalty
While your spirit has 5 or more influence, you no longer suffer the -2 penalty 
to initiative caused from your spirit's influence. However, your spirit's unique 
penalty is doubled. If your spirit has at least 7 influence, the penalty is 
tripled instead, and if your spirit has at least 9 influence, the penalty is 
quadrupled instead. 

## Spellcasting
While your spirit has 5 or more influence, your spellcasting is modified. If the 
spirit possessing you is the Archmage, all Medium spells you cast are arcane 
spells instead of psychic spells. If the spirit possessing you is the Hierophant, 
all Medium spells you cast are divine spells instead of psychic spells. 
If the spirit possessing you is neither of these, you may not cast spells.
