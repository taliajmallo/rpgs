# Possessed Maiden (Medium Archetype)
Instead of channeling spirits, you draw from your past indoctrination and 
training as a Grey Maiden to empower you. 

## Proficiencies
Possessed maidens are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all 
types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and with shields (except tower 
shields).
This alters the medium's armor and weapon proficiencies. 

## Class skills
A possessed maiden gains Climb, Knowledge (Geography), Knowledge (History), 
Knowledge (Local), Knowledge (Nobility), Ride, Survival, and Swim as class 
skills, but does not gain Fly, Knowledge (Arcana), Knowledge (Planes), 
Linguistics, Perform, Spellcraft, or Use Magic Device as class skills. 
This alters the medium's class skills. 

## Indoctrination (Ex)
A possessed maiden compulsively resists channeling her prior indoctrination, but 
certain triggers (such as violence) can cause her to lapse. The possessed maiden
may use a full-round action to make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 her medium level) 
to recall her training; if she fails, she becomes shaken for 1 minute and cannot 
try again during this time. If exposed to mortal peril (such as the start of 
combat), a possessed maiden must succeed at a Will save at the same DC or 
immediately recall her training. 

When a possessed maiden recalls her training through this class feature, she 
chooses either the Champion spirit, the Guardian spirit, or the Marshal spirit. 
She gains that spirit's seance boon, influence penalty, and lesser spirit power 
until the next time she becomes unconscious. The possessed maiden also gains the 
spiritâ€™s intermediate spirit power at 6th level, its greater spirit power at 
11th level, and its supreme spirit power at 17th level. The possessed maiden may
make a Will save against the same DC as earlier to end the effect early; if she
fails, she cannot end the effect early for the rest of the day. 

Any spirit abilities that affect allies who participated in your seance instead
affect any allies within your line of sight when you gained your seance boon. 

Any spirit abilities that grant the spirit any number of points of influence 
over you instead expend uses of Superior Training equal to the number of points 
of influence. 

This is considered to be a compulsion effect caused by a lawful evil creature, 
regardless of the possessed maiden's alignment. 

This ability replaces Spirit.  

## Superior Training (Ex)
After failing a d20 roll that was modified by her spirit bonus, a possessed 
maiden may add 1d6 to the check's result without taking an action. This may 
cause the check to succeed instead of fail. The possessed maiden must be 
conscious and aware to use this ability, and she may use it at most once per 
round. At 10th level, she may add 1d8 instead, and at 20th level she may add 
1d10 instead. This ability may be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + 
the possessed maiden's charisma modifier. 

Any spirit abilities that affect Spirit Surge also affect this ability. 
This ability replaces Spirit Surge, Taboo, Propitiation, and Spirit Mastery. 

## Bonds of Sisterhood (Ex)
At 2nd level, a possessed maiden grants her current seance boon to all adjacent 
allies. 
This ability replaces Shared Seance. 

## Equipment Specialization (Ex)
At 3rd level, when a possessed maiden gains the Guardian's Shield lesser spirit
power, she gains the benefit of the Fighter's armor training class feature, 
treating her medium level as her fighter level. 
At 5th level, when a possessed maiden gains the Champion's Prowess lesser spirit
power, she gains the benefit of the Fighter's weapon training class feature, 
treating her medium level as her fighter level. 
The medium is always considered to have armor training and weapon training as a
fighter of her level for the purposes of qualifying for feat prerequisites, 
but only gains the benefits of feats with those prerequisites when she has the 
appropriate lesser spirit power. 
This ability replaces spellcasting, Haunt Channeler, Location Channel, 
Connection Channel, Ask the Spirits, Astral Journey, and Spacious Soul.

## Mixed Tactics (Ex)
At 15th level, as a swift action, a possessed maiden expend one use of Superior
Training to gain the intermediate spirit power of the Champion, Guardian, or 
Marshal spirit for one round per level. This may be used during Indoctrination 
to gain a second spirit's intermediate power. 
This ability replaces Trance of Three. 

## Paragon Training (Ex)
At 20th level, whenever a possessed maiden chooses a spirit to channel for 
Indoctrination, she may instead choose to channel all three simultaneously, 
gaining each of their seance boons, influence penalties, and spirit powers. 
This ability replaces Astral Beacon.
