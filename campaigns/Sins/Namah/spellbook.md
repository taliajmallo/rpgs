You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long 
you study a particular area or subject.
1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent 
aura.
3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures 
bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill 
checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per 
aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If 
the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties 
(see Spellcraft).
Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may 
distort or conceal weaker auras.

You can whisper messages and receive whispered replies. Those nearby can hear 
these messages with a DC 25 Perception check. You point your finger at each 
creature you want to receive the message. When you whisper, the whispered 
message is audible to all targeted creatures within range. Magical silence, 1 
foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal (or a thin sheet of lead), or 3 feet of 
wood or dirt blocks the spell. The message does not have to travel in a straight 
line. It can circumvent a barrier if there is an open path between you and the 
subject, and the path’s entire length lies within the spell’s range. The 
creatures that receive the message can whisper a reply that you hear. The spell 
transmits sound, not meaning; it doesn’t transcend language barriers. To speak a 
message, you must mouth the words and whisper.
