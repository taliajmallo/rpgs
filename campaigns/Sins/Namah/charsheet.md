### Strength of Submission (Faith)
Whenever you are under the effects of a compulsion effect, you gain a +1 trait 
bonus on attack and damage rolls.
### Shield Bearer (Race)
Benefit When performing a shield bash, you deal 1 additional point of damage. 
Also, once per day on your turn as a free action, you may provide one adjacent 
ally a +2 trait bonus to his Armor Class. This bonus lasts for 1 round, so long 
as you and the target remain adjacent to one another. You can only use this 
ability if you are using a shield. You retain your shield bonus to your armor 
class when using this ability.
### Shield-Trained (Religion)
Heavy and light shields are considered simple weapons rather than martial 
weapons for you. Heavy shields are considered light weapons for you.
### Favored Class: Possessed Maiden IV
Add 1/6 to your Spirit Bonus. 

## Racial Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, you have a movement speed of 30 feet, and you can see in
complete darkness (including magical darkness), but are completely colorblind. 
You are a native outsider. 
### Soul-Sight
You are permanently under the effect of Deathwatch. You can instantly tell 
whether any creatures you can see within 30 feet are dead, fragile (<=3 HP), 
injured (>=4 HP), healthy, undead, or neither alive nor dead, and Knowledge 
(Planes) is always a class skill for you. 
### Wings
You are permanently under the effect of a nonmagical featherfall, and may glide
5 feet horizontally per 1 foot vertical (for an overland speed of 60 feet per
round). You gain +4 to Fly checks, and Fly is always a class skill for you. 

## Shield-Sister Features (Sister-in-Arms, Knight of the Wall Cavalier)
### Edict of the Scarlet Rose
You must remain loyal to your allies and always work to further the aims of the 
group. You must protect your allies from harm, and defend their honor when 
called into doubt. If you fail at these edicts, you may not challenge foes for
24 hours. 
### Challenge
Twice per day, you may challenge a foe as a swift action. You deal extra damage
on melee attacks against the target equal to 1/2 your level (minimum 1), and 
gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against attacks made by the target, but suffer 
a -2 penalty to AC against all attacks not made by the target of your challenge. 
Allies also gain a +1 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls against the 
target whenever you are threatening the target. 
The bonuses to AC and allies' attack rolls increase by +1 at 4th level and every
four levels thereafter, and you gain an additional use per day of this ability 
every three levels after 1st. 
### Skills of the Order
You gain a bonus to Survival checks to provide fresh water and food for allies 
or to protect allies against harsh weather equal to 1/2 your level (minimum 1)
and may attempt Knowledge (Nobility) checks untrained. 
### Shield Expertise
You gain Shield Focus (AC granted by shields increased by 1) as a bonus feat, 
and your cavalier levels count as fighter levels for the purpose of qualifying
for any feats that list Shield Focus as a prerequisite. 
### Aid Allies
Your Aid Another grants +3 instead of +2. This increases at 8th level and every
6 thereafter.
### Lion's Call
As a standard action, you can give a rallying speech. Allies within 60' gain a
+6 (CHA Mod) competence bonus on saves versus fear and a +1 competence bonus on
attack rolls. This lasts 2 (Cav level) rounds. If an affected ally is already
suffering from a spell or effect that causes frightened or panicked, the ally
can make a new saving throw immediately. 
### Bodyguard
When an adjacent ally is attacked, you may use an attack of opportunity to 
attempt the aid another action to improve your ally’s AC. You may not use the 
aid another action to improve your ally’s attack roll with this attack.
### Maiden's Loyalty
Gain a +2 bonus to any will saves against an affect that would cause you to 
attack your allies. 

## Possessed Maiden Features (Possessed Maiden Medium)
### Indoctrination 
You may make a Will save, DC 12 (10 + 1/2 class level), as a full-round
action to channel a spirit. Failure leaves you shaken for a minute. If exposed 
to mortal danger, you must make a Will save to avoid channeling a spirit. You 
can end this effect early with another will save. 
When channeling a spirit, you gain its seance boon, influence penalty, and 
lesser power. Any abilities that would cost influence instead cost a daily
use of Superior Training. 
This is considered to be a compulsion caused by a lawful evil creature.  
### Spirit Bonus / Spirit Surge
You gain a +2 bonus to certain checks, statistics, and rolls, determined by your
current spirit. At most once per round, after failing a d20 roll modified by 
this bonus, you may  immediately add 1d6 to the check's result without taking an 
action. This may be used 9 (3 + CHA Modifier) times per day. 
### Bonds of Sisterhood
You grant your seance boon to any adjacent allies. At 5th level, this improves 
to all allies within 30 feet.

### Talents
#### Shield-Sister
When using a longsword and a heavy shield, you are treated as if you had the 
two-weapon fighting feat. This allows you to take feats that require two-weapon
fighting as a prerequisite without meeting the two-weapon fighting or dexterity
prerequisites, but you only benefit from such feats while using a longsword and
a heavy shield. 
#### Sisterhood Combat I (Sisterhood Style)
While using this style and wielding a longsword and a light or heavy shield, you 
gain a +1 bonus on Reflex and Will saving throws. In addition, when you enter 
the Sisterhood Style stance, you can choose a teamwork feat you have. As a swift 
action, you can grant that feat to an ally within 10 feet until the beginning of 
your next turn.
<!-- ### Sisterhood Combat II (Sisterhood Rampart)
While using Sisterhood Style, you and adjacent allies gain an additional +1 
bonus to the shield bonus granted by Shield Wall, and each of you adds your 
shield bonus to AC (not counting enhancement bonuses) to your CMD against bull 
rush combat maneuvers. In addition, you and adjacent allies do not provide soft 
cover against allies’ attacks. -->

## Feats
### Grey Maiden Initiate (1st)
*Deeper Indoctrination:* Mental conditioning has bolstered your mind against 
most magical control. You gain a +1 bonus on Will saving throws, except when 
resisting charm or compulsion effects created by lawful evil creatures, in which 
case you instead take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws.
*Tamed and Broken:* You reach your full potential only when magically compelled. 
Whenever you are under the effects of an enemy’s compulsion spell, you gain a 
number of temporary hit points equal to the spell’s level. These temporary hit 
points last for the duration of the spell effect.
### Weapon Focus, Longsword (1st Antihero)
You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls with a Longsword. 
### Precise Strike (3rd, Teamwork)
Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are flanking the same the 
creature, you deal an additional 1d6 points of precision damage with each 
successful melee attack. This bonus damage stacks with other sources of 
precision damage, such as sneak attack. This bonus damage is not multiplied on 
a critical hit.
<!-- ### Shield Wall (5th, Teamwork)
Whenever you are wielding a shield and are adjacent to an ally wielding a shield 
who also has this feat, the AC bonus from your shield increases, depending on 
the shield wielded by your ally. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a 
light shield, your shield bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a 
heavy shield or a tower shield, your shield bonus increases by +2. You keep 
these bonuses even if your ally loses his shield bonus due to making a shield 
bash attack. If an adjacent ally with this feat uses a tower shield to grant 
total cover, you also benefit if an attack targeting you passes through the edge 
of the shield.-->
<!-- ### Sisterhood Dedication (6th)
While you’re using Sisterhood Style and wielding a longsword and either a light 
or heavy shield, the bonus on saving throws from Sisterhood Style increases to 
+2 and you grant half that bonus to all allies within 20 feet. In addition, you 
can choose up to two teamwork feats you have when entering the Sisterhood Style 
stance. As a swift action, you can grant one of those feats to two allies within 
20 feet until the beginning of your next turn, or you can grant both feats to 
one ally within 20 feet until the beginning of your next turn. -->
