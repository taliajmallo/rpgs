complete darkness (including magical darkness), but are completely colorblind. 
You are a native outsider. 
### Bonded Mind

don’t need to whisper or point, and you cannot be overheard.
### Soul-Sight

whether any creatures you can see within 30 feet are dead, fragile (<=3 HP),

## Shield-Sister Features (Sister-in-Arms, Knight of the Wall Cavalier)
### Edict of the Scarlet Rose
You must remain loyal to your allies and always work to further the aims of the 
group. You must protect your allies from harm, and defend their honor when 
called into doubt. If you fail at these edicts, you may not challenge foes for
24 hours. 
### Challenge
Once per day, you may challenge a foe as a swift action. You deal extra damage
on melee attacks against the target equal to 1/2 your level (minimum 1), and 
gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against attacks made by the target, but suffer 
a -2 penalty to AC against all attacks not made by the target of your challenge. 
Allies also gain a +1 circumstance bonus on melee attack rolls against the 
target whenever you are threatening the target.

every three levels after 1st.

## Fiend Keeper Features (Fiend Keeper Medium)
### Evil Spirit
At the start of each day, select a single Spirit you currently have access to. 
You invite it into yourself, granting it a single point of influence in exchange
for its seance boon and lesser spirit power. 
Rather than channel the spirits of dead heroes, you invoke aspects of a fragment
of a Devil Lord's soul that you have bound within you. Willingly performing an
evil act automatically grants any current spirit 1 point of influence over you.
Protection From Evil suppresses all of the spirit's benefits for the duration
of the spell. 
When your current spirit has at least 3 points of influence, you gain a +4 bonus
to saving throws against possession, a +2 bonus to saving throws against effects
that are mind-affecting but not possession, a -2 penalty to initiative, and an 
evil aura as per a cleric of your level. Treat your alignment as evil for the 
purposes of resisting or being vulnerable to spells and abilities while you have
this aura. Furthermore, each spirit has a unique extra penalty. 
If your current spirit ever gains 5 or more points of influence over you, you 
completely lose control to the spirit. 
You may forgo any number of spirit powers you would normally gain to gain two
free uses of Spirit Surge that do not incur influence gain. 
### Spirit Bonus / Spirit Surge
You gain a +1 bonus to certain checks, statistics, and rolls, determined by your
current spirit. At most once per round, after failing a d20 roll modified by 
this bonus, you may allow your spirit to gain 1 additional point of influence 
over you to immediately add 1d6 to the check's result without taking an action. 

## Feats
### Grey Maiden Initiate (1st)
*Deeper Indoctrination:* Mental conditioning has bolstered your mind against 
most magical control. You gain a +1 bonus on Will saving throws, except when 
resisting charm or compulsion effects created by lawful evil creatures, in which 
case you instead take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws.
*Tamed and Broken:* You reach your full potential only when magically compelled. 
Whenever you are under the effects of an enemy’s compulsion spell, you gain a 
number of temporary hit points equal to the spell’s level. These temporary hit 
points last for the duration of the spell effect.
### Weapon Focus, Longsword (1st Antihero)
You gain a +1 bonus on all attack rolls with a Longsword. 
<!-- ### Sisterhood Style (3rd)
While using this style and wielding a longsword and a light or heavy shield, you 
gain a +1 bonus on Reflex and Will saving throws. In addition, when you enter the 
Sisterhood Style stance, you can choose a teamwork feat you have. As a swift 
action, you can grant that feat to an ally within 10 feet until the beginning of 
your next turn. -->
<!-- ### Healer's Hands (5th), Below, OR some other teamwork feat (Combat Medic?)
You can use the Heal skill to treat deadly wounds as a full-round action. You do
not take a penalty for not using a healer’s kit when treating deadly wounds this 
way, and you can do so on a given creature more than once per day. When treating 
deadly wounds this way, if your result exceeds the DC by 10 or more, add your 
ranks in Knowledge (planes) to the damage healed. These benefits do not apply to 
creatures that are not healed by positive energy. You can use this feat’s 
benefit a number of times per day equal to your ranks in Knowledge (planes). -->
<!-- ### Take the Hit (6th Cavalier Bonus Feat)
As long as an ally with the Bonded Mind feat is adjacent to you, you can choose 
to absorb up to half of the hit point damage from any attack that strikes him, 
as if subject to a shield other spell. Using this ability is an immediate action, 
and it only applies to one attack, even if the ally is hit by multiple attacks 
as part of the same action. -->
<!-- ### Sisterhood Rampart (7th)
While using Sisterhood Style, you and adjacent allies gain an additional +1 
bonus to the shield bonus granted by Shield Wall, and each of you adds your 
shield bonus to AC (not counting enhancement bonuses) to your CMD against bull 
rush combat maneuvers. In addition, you and adjacent allies do not provide soft 
cover against allies’ attacks. -->
<!-- ### Sisterhood Dedication (9th)
While you’re using Sisterhood Style and wielding a longsword and either a light 
or heavy shield, the bonus on saving throws from Sisterhood Style increases to 
+2 and you grant half that bonus to all allies within 20 feet. In addition, you 
can choose up to two teamwork feats you have when entering the Sisterhood Style 
stance. As a swift action, you can grant one of those feats to two allies within 
20 feet until the beginning of your next turn, or you can grant both feats to 
one ally within 20 feet until the beginning of your next turn. -->
