# Namah's Fiendish Facets

## Butcher (Str)
### Spirit Bonus
Attack rolls, non-spell damage rolls, Strength checks and skills, 
Fortitude saves
### Seance Boon
You gain a +2 bonus on all non-spell damage rolls.
### Influence Penalty
Take a penalty to Intelligence checks and skills, as well as caster level, equal
to your spirit bonus. This can reduce the max level of spells you can cast. 
### Lesser Power
Gain proficiency with the spiked chain. Any slashing weapon or spiked chain you 
wield gains the deadly property and deals bleed damage on critical hits equal to
the weapon's critical multiplier - 1.

## Twice-Damned-Prince (Dex)
### Spirit Bonus
Dexterity checks and skills, Reflex saves
### Seance Boon
Choose a skill. Gain a +1 bonus to that skill, and it counts as a class skill. 
### Influence Penalty
You never count as an ally for the purposes of gaining benefits from another 
creature's abilities, nor are you a willing target for spells. Anyone attempting
to target you with a touch-range spell must succeed at a melee touch attack, but
you do not need to attempt a saving throw. You cannot benefit from Aid Another.
### Lesser Power
Choose any two skills. These skills count as class skills for you, and you are 
treated as if you had an additional number of ranks in those skills equal to 
your level. 

## Terminator (Con)
### Spirit Bonus
AC, Constitution checks, Fortitude saves, Reflex saves
### Seance Boon
+1 Bonus to CMD
### Influence Penalty
Take a penalty on damage rolls equal to your spirit bonus. 
### Lesser Power
You automatically stabilize when at negative hitpoints, and you are killed only
if your negative hit point total exceeds double your Constitution score. In 
addition, you can allow the Terminator to gain 1 point of influence over you to
automatically end any bleed or blood drain effect, or any effect with the pain
descriptor. Doing so is not an action, and you can do this even if unconscious. 

## Lich (Int)
### Spirit Bonus
Concentration checks, Intelligence checks and skills
### Seance Boon
You gain a +4 bonus on damage rolls with your necromancy spells.
### Influence Penalty
Take a penalty on Strength checks and skills, Constitution checks, attack rolls,
and non-spell damage rolls equal to your spirit bonus. 
### Lesser Power
Change your spells-per-day table to the Mesmerist's. You gain the following 
spells known: 0—bleed; 1st—chill touch; 2nd—command undead; 3rd—animate dead; 
4th—enervation; 5th—magic jar; 6th—create greater undead. These count as arcane
spells instead of psychic spells. 

## Heretic (Wis)
### Spirit Bonus
Wisdom checks and skills, Will saves
### Seance Boon
For the purposes of spells and effects that rely on your deity or alignment, you
count as worshipping a Lawful Good deity of your choice. 
### Influence Penalty
You must deal nonlethal damage whenever possible. You take a penalty equal to 
your spirit bonus to all Charisma checks and skills involving worshippers of 
other faiths than the Seance Boon deity. 
### Lesser Power
Change your spells-per-day table to the Mesmerist's. You gain the following 
spells known: 0—guidance; 1st—divine favor; 2nd—castigate; 3rd—terrible remorse;
4th—reprobation; 5th—mass castigate; 6th—overwhelming presence. These count as 
divine spells instead of psychic spells. Whenever you use your spirit surge on a 
skill check or ability check to convince or trick someone into perverting his 
faith in the Seance Boon deity, the Heretic is pleased and does not gain the 
usual point of influence over you.

## Warmonger (Cha)
### Spirit Bonus
Charisma checks and skills, spirit surge rolls.  
### Seance Boon
Choose any other spirit's seance boon. When using the shared seance class 
feature, each participant may choose a different boon. 
### Influence Penalty
Take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus to all Wisdom checks and skills. If
you are not at least nominally in charge of your present allies, you lose your 
spirit bonus and seance boon. 
### Lesser Power
You can use spirit surge on your own attack rolls, or those of allies within 30 
feet who participated in your seance, as long as you have line of sight and line
of effect. You can also use your spirit surge when an enemy takes an action that 
would provoke an attack of opportunity from you or such an ally; you or the ally
make an attack of opportunity and add your spirit surge, and that attack of 
opportunity does not count against either of your normal limit for the round. 
When you use a spirit surge on an attack roll and it hits, that attack's damage
roll also benefits from the spirit surge.
