## Merits
### Hollow I
You have access to the interdimensional doctor's office in the Hedge.

### Lair I
You have an apartment.

### Resources I
You have ~$500/month.

### Striking Looks IV
- Advantage: +2 to Presence/Manipulation when using your looks.
- Disadvantage: You are memorable, and draw attention.

## Innate Qualities
### Benefits
#### Pyros
- You gain Pyros in the following ways:
  - One Pyros is gained automatically each dawn.
  - Once per day, gain a Pyros by standing in a thunderstorm, under the sky.
  - When you sleep amidst voices (not recordings) that last into your first
    hour of sleep, you roll Azoth + Composure upon awakening, and gain one
    Pyros per success.

#### Superlative Endurance
- You can go 48 hours without incurring fatigue penalties, and sleep for less
  time when forced to sleep due to fatigue.
- You ignore all wound penalties.
- Bashing damage does not knock you out, and lethal damage does not kill you.
  Lethal damage rolling over to aggravated damage, if in your last 5 boxes of
  health, causes limb loss.
- [ ] Once ever, after dying while at Azoth 2+, you can resurrect roughly 24
  hours later, at the cost of all but one dot of Azoth.

#### Superlative Constitution
- You can eat any organic substance, and emit no waste. Gain a +2 to Survival
  rolls to forage in the wild. 
- If you go more than Min(Stamina, Resolve) days without eating, you build
  Torment.
- If you go more than Stamina + Resolve days without eating, you suffer
  Deprivation as normal, but without the susceptibility to disease.
- Gain a +4 to Stamina rolls against against drugs, poisons, toxins, disease,
  infection, and other such conditions. You struggle to become intoxicated from
  any substance. Painkillers and anesthetics are only half as effective.

#### Electroshock Therapy
- Electricity heals you at a rate of:
  - 1 point of electric bashing heals 1 point of bashing damage.
  - 2 points of electric bashing heal 1 point of lethal damage.
  - 3 points of electric bashing heal 1 point of aggravated damage.
- Bashing wounds heal first, then lethal, then aggravated. Any overflow will
  discharge in arcs around you, and affects anyone touching you.
- After healing in this manner, and for a number of turns after equal to your
  Azoth, your disfigurements are visible.

#### Transhuman Potential
- You can increase an attribute for one turn, up to your Azoth in additional
  dots, at a cost of one Pyros per additional dot.

### Drawbacks
#### Divine Fire
- Fire inflicts aggravated damage to you.

#### Disfigurements
- Spending any Pyros momentarily reveals your disfigurements.

#### Disquiet
- When a human is exposed to your presence for any amount of time longer than a
  casual passing on the street, the human must roll Resolve + Composure against
  your Azoth as a die pool. Victims suffer -1 penalties if already under the
  effects of Disquiet, or if witnessing an obvious supernatural effect. They
  gain a +1 bonus if they cannot see you. You gain a +1 bonus to your roll if
  currently affected by Torment.
  - Dramatic Failure: The victim gains 2 stages of Disquiet.
  - Failure: The victim gains 1 stage of Disquiet.
  - Success: The victim does not gain disquiet this scene.
  - Exceptional Success: The victim does not gain disquiet this day.
- Disquiet reduces by 1 stage if you avoid the victim for a number of weeks
  equal to your Azoth.
- Disquiet has the following four stages:
  - Dream: The victim has unsettling dreams involving you, and struggles to 
    get proper sleep. They take a -1 die penalty to any tasks on the day after
    such dreams.
  - Fantasy: When the victim sees you or a situation that pertains to your 
    governing humor (sanguine - courage or lust), they may slip into a fantasy
    about you in some capacity. They take a -2 penalty to all die pools while
    fantasizing, and often feel queasy with shame or disgust afterwards.
  - Impulse: The victim is drawn to act on their Disquiet. Doing something
    other than what their Disquiet demands of them suffers a -2 die penalty
    until they act on that impulse. If this would demand an illegal action of
    them, they may roll a Resolve + Composure test at -2 penalty to resist.
    Additionally, they gain a mild derangement appropriate to the Disquiet.
  - Driven: Any action not related to the victim's Disquiet takes a -3 die
    penalty. They suffer this penalty to any Resolve or Composure test they may
    make. The minor derangement from the Impulse stage becomes more severe. The
    victim may also induce temporary first-stage Disquiet, lasting a number of
    nights equal to your Azoth, by making a Wits, Intelligence, Presence, or
    Manipulation based roll against another victim's Resolve + Composure.
    Finally, this stage of disquiet does not reduce unless you are destroyed.
    After you are destroyed, it requires a number of months equal to your 
    Azoth to reduce to the Impulse stage.

#### Wasteland
- Instead of the traditional Wasteland effect, attempts to exit the Hedge to a
  location within your Azoth's radiance gain a die bonus equal to half your
  Azoth, rounded up, if the entity is familiar with you.

#### Torment
- The following triggers all can cause Torment:
  - Disquiet bringing a human to act against you (Wits + Empathy to try to
    identify whether Disquiet is truly at fault; failure assumes it is)
  - Your creator standing in the way of your Pilgrimage
  - Fire being used as a threat or weapon against you
  - The first time each scene you suffer direct aggravated damage
  - If you fail in a Mortality milestone for any reason
  - If you go more than Min(Stamina, Resolve) days without eating
- When any of the above occur, roll your Humanity, once for each condition.
  - Dramatic Failure: Succumb to Torment, lose a Willpower point, and gain a
    mild derangement.
  - Failure: Succumb to Torment.
  - Success: Resist this instance of Torment. If the condition continues, you
    may have to make additional tests.
  - Exceptional Success: Resist this instance of Torment and restore a point of
    Willpower.
- When subject to Torment, any expenditure of Pyros costs an additional Pyros.
  Once Torment passes, you are morose and withdrawn for a number of hours equal
  to your Azoth, and cannot spend or regain any Willpower points.
- As a Galateid, your Torment drives you to foolhardiness and unhealthy
  fixation on the object(s) of your affection. Additionally, take a -1 penalty
  to any Wits roll. Your Torment lasts until your fascination is resolved, or
  for a number of hours equal to your Azoth, whichever happens first.


## Transmutations
### Mesmerizing Appearance (Galateid Bestowment)
- Cost: None or 1 Pyros
- Action: Reflexive
- Gain 9-again on any social roll affected by your beauty. If you fail such a
roll, you may spend 1 Pyros to re-roll without 9-again. Additionally, you may
increase your Presence and Manipulation above the mortal limit of 5 dots.

### Attuned to the Wyrd (Fetch Bestowment)
- Cost: None
- Action: None
- You can see through changelings' fae miens and mortal guises. In addition,
  you can tell when a changeling is within your Azoth's Radiance. You cannot
  tell one changeling from another using this sense, with the sole exception
  of your progenitor changeling.

### Soothe Disquiet (Disquietism I)
- Cost: 1 Pyros
- Action Reflexive
- For the rest of the scene, any person contending with Disquiet gains a +1 die
  bonus to their Resolve + Composure roll. It also prevents the first stage of
  Disquiet from advancing ot the second stage. A mortal cannot be affected by
  thus power for longer than 24 hours. For the week afterwards, they
  automatically fail Disquiet rolls against you.

### Suggestion (Mesmerism II)
- Cost: None
- Action: Contested
- Die Pool: Manipulation + Intelligence + Persuasion vs Composure + Azoth
- Whisper an instruction in the target's ear. This has a -2 penalty unless the 
  victim is asleep or incapacitated by the Fixed Stare Transmutation.
  - Dramatic Failure: The target is immune to your Mesmerism for one full day.
  - Failure: The attempt to influence the target fails.
  - Success: You may give an instruction of up to one concise sentence per
    success, which the target forgets hearing. The target also must succeed at
    a Resolve + Composure test with a dice penalty equal to your Azoth in order
    to remember the encounter. Once the command is given, you may speak a code
    word at any time within one day per Azoth, that causes the target to carry
    out the instructions. Alternatively, you may give a specific situation that
    causes the target to act. You cannot cause the target to attack others or
    perform inherently dangerous actions, but can cause the target to do things
    that might cause others to attack them.
  - Exceptional Success: The target cannot remember that you gave them the
    suggestion.
