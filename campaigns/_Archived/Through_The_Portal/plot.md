## Plot Threads
### Summoned for a Reason
- [ ] Eclipsed Court fae summons party w/ ritual
- [ ] Eclipsed Court was expecting a spirit, not an otherworlder
- [ ] Armored figures (cambion paladins) smash thru door, shouts something ("Dead king take you, cultist!"), stabs summoner thru the heart with a shining blade
  - [ ] If party takes action before stab, still gets a slash off & wounds summoner; summoner helps fight
  - [ ] If party takes action after stab, before execution finished, summoner lays bleeding out
  - [ ] If party does not take action, proceeds to decapitate summoner, says something to players (doesn't want to kill them but knows he should), attacks
- [ ] Diff 7 to save summoner if slashed, diff 9 if stabbed, impossible if decapitated
- [ ] if summoner slashed/stabbed, will bid the players to oppose the Demon Queen
  - [ ] True motivation: for humans and demons alike to die in war so the fae have less obstacles to their return
- [ ] Players set out
