## Advantages and Anima
### Getimian Alchemy
Divide your motes between two pools - Flowing and Still. You may reallocate
motes between the pools between sessions or during downtime, but must leave a
mote in each pool. When you spend or regain motes, you may choose which pool to
spend or regain. Gain a one-success bonus to Force when Flowing is larger, a
one-success bonus to Finesse when Still is larger, or instead a one-success
bonus to Fortitude when the pools are equal (if even total) or off by one (if
odd total).
### Infected Fate
You may spend 1 mote to bind a target to you, naming a role in relation to you.
While acting in that roll, the character transforms your Essence in dice into
successes before rolling; if they act against it, they suffer a one-success
penalty. This lasts for one session.
### Resonance
You are resonant with starmetal.
### Orderly World Insight (Passive)
### Deception Withers Away (Active)
### Laws of a New Creation (Iconic)
## Charms and Sorceries
### Sagacity Excellence
Spend 1 mote. This applies on Step 1 during combat. Add 5 bonus dice to a
Sagacity roll
### Sorcerous Initiation
You may learn and cast First Circle sorceries. Gain a free spell and shaping
ritual.
### Necromantic Initiation
You may learn and cast First Circle necromancies. Gain a free spell and shaping
ritual.
### Finding the Chorus
Commit 1 mote for the scene. Until the mote is uncommitted, all observers gain a
temporary Minor Intimacy towards the Getimian.
[Flowing] - The intimacy is one of love, affection, loyalty, or the like.
[Still] - The intimacy is one of awe, fear, reverence, or the like.
### Unforged Masterworks
Commit 1 mote for the scene. Create a secondary Artifact weapon. This temporary
weapon gains a unique inherent ability of your and the Storyteller's design. If
you cancel the committed mote and reactivate this charm in the same scene, it
creates the same weapon.
[Flowing] - Every extra you strike down with this weapon vanishes and reappears as
your Origin's version of him. Treat this as a temporary Followers Merit if the
Getimian uses this charm on multiple targets. At the end of the scene, all loyal
extras created by this Charm vanish with the artifact weapon.
[Still] - When you successfully defend against a decisive attack, you may make
an influence action against your opponent on Step 8, as if it were a counter.
