## Pre-campaign notes
- "How evil are the Aelfir?" -> I'm always interested in alien psychologies
- "How mystic is the Ministry?" -> No opinion
- "How common is magic in general?"
  - Magic as in done by people: common
  - Magic as in phenomena: common
  - Magic as in items that are affected by, or used for, magic: common
  - Magic as in, items created with the specific intent of being magical in a particular way: rare
- Areas of Ivory Row I find interesting:
  - Sunlight Collective -> Honestly, it'd be surprising if Galene didn't already have contacts there
  - Archbishop Wynn -> Maybe more amenable to Galene than Aelfir might...?
  - The human college -> I think there's maybe something neat here I could tug on, not sure what


## Backstory TODO: CLEAN THIS UP
- Mom (Miriam) is a washed-up knight who got one too many severe injuries and can no longer go a-fightin' but still carouses with her buddies (and spends quite a bit of coin on drink); I haven't figured out what the other parents do but I'm mildly inclined for one to be Lajhan for the drama.

- Mom sends Galene off on an early and double-length durance at the age of 12 - longer either to pay off debt collectors, and/or because the cushy durance she ended up getting was a very limited offer; I haven't yet sorted out exactly why or how the other parents feel about it or how much they were involved in the decision.

- Her Aelfir lord during her durance, Gilded-Spirit-Enlightens-the-Unwise, was a "progressive" one - he's hedonistic and debauched to a fault, and is very involved in the Artistic™️ scene as both (scandal-causing) author & playwright and patron of other artistes.

- smol Galene was pretty enough for him to keep around as a walking art arrangement and conversation piece, but eventually (and probably while on several brands of drugs, because all things considered it was a pretty stupid decision) he got tired of her meek innocence and figured that having her turn into a blood-witch would probably solve at least one of those.

- Her true form just so happens to evoke Solar religious iconography, with skin resembling marble and eyes and ~~claws~~ nails of everfrost.

- Lord saw this, and immediately took to the idea of putting her (in true form) into religious plays and festivals and the like - the conversation with his Partners in Art went something like "Are you sure you want her in the play? Casting a Drow is scandalous enough for the stuffy types to have a conniption; casting a blood-witch in her true form might get you thrown to the Paladins..." "Nonsense, my friend, look at her! She's perfect for a role about a young Drow overcoming the limitations of her species, and being blessed by Mother Winter! Or perhaps a dangerous, monstrous beast being tamed by a disciple of Sister Spring! I won't let this opportunity go to waste!"

- Said production was, of course, incredibly scandalous, but the avant-garde Aelfir loved it, and so their community had her star in more ceremonies and the like, hence her being one of relatively few Drow Cousins of the Divine Family.

- Because of her involvement in these festivals, it was hard for her to not become involved with the religion - the Aelfir might look down on her, but they still ooh'd and aah'd at her being seemingly blessed by the solar gods, and they encouraged her to be a good citizen of Spire and learn more about the Solar Church, so she ended up feeling actually rather welcomed there, all things considered; it wasn't long before she became a true Solar Devotee.

- Between the festivals and her lord's parties where she was a showpiece, she probably spent more time in her true form than not. She has very mixed feelings on being a blood-witch, since witches are cursed things that the Aelfir usually put to death, but if there ever was a sign that the solar gods were actively present in her life, her true form is it.

- All things come to an end, her durance included; at the age of 20 she went home to her parents completely unrecognizable from the girl they sent up-spire. Reuniting with her family was awkward and drama-filled, but Galene was, for a while, glad to be home.

- Prudence (Violet's character) implicated and/or framed Galene for a crime, and threatened and blackmailed Galene into flee the district with her. Upon arriving in Ivory Row, Prudence sent Galene to (Jay's character), who un-marked Galene for death in exchange for a favor.
