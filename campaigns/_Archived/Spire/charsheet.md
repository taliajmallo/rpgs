## Abilities & Advances
### Blood-Witch
#### Night Terror [Occult]
*You have a history of fear in the city of Spire.* Once per session, when you
meet an NPC for the first time, declare that they have have wronged you in the
past, and live in fear of your reprisal. They are now terrified of you, with all
the risks that entails.
#### Echoes [Occult]
*You can taste the intricacies of a person in their blood.* When you taste the
blood of a creature, you will learn something interesting or surprising about
their past or future. The blood must still be warm; the colder it is, the less
accurate and more disjointed the visions will be. Visions of the future are
inaccurate at best and misleading at worst, but they will represent one
potential future for the target. (You cannot derive any information from
tasting the blood of a cold-blooded creature.)
#### True Form [Occult]
*Try as you might, you just can't keep the writhing terror inside yourself.*
Since returning from the Heart, your true self pushes and boils beneath the
surface of your skin. If you ever take moderate or severe fallout of any kind,
you shift into the form that the Heart wishes you to be - a flickering zoetrope
horror. Your fingers twitch and flex and your movements are stop-motion and
disjointed; your shoulders pop and creak as they bend at the wrong points and
the stench of old blood fills the air. You gain the Compel and Pursue skills,
and anyone with an ounce of sense will most likely run from you. You may attempt
to stop this change with a Resist+Occult roll. Your true form lasts until the
end of the situation. You can mark D3 stress to shift into your true form at any
time.
#### Blood-Bound Companion [Occult] (I, III)
*You strengthen your bond with your familiar.* Gain +1 Mind and the Sneak skill.
Your familiar can talk to people other than you, and can very briefly shift to
become incorporeal.
#### Hearts-Blood Thrall [Occult] (III, IV)
*Your cursed blood has warped your familiar's body almost beyond recognition,*
*turning it into something truly monstrous.* Gain +1 Mind and the Steal skill.
Once per session, you can see through the eyes of your familiar and control its
movements for a situation, and at the end of each session, ask the GM what
tidbits your familiar tells you as it whispers secrets about those around you
into your ear while you sleep.

### Cousin of the Divine Family
#### Sister Thaw Your Heart
*You appeal to Sister Spring to help someone transcend their prejudices and*
*see clearly.* Once per session, decide who the underdog is in a given conflict.
This need not be the obvious or logical choice: Sister Spring is more beguiled
by a compelling story than a dull fact. Roll with Mastery when you attempt to
convince someone to take the side of said underdog.
### Mother Steel Me
*You ask Mother Winter to gift you patience and restraint.*
+1 Mind. Once per session, when you pray to the Winter goddess, reduce Mind
stress by D6.
