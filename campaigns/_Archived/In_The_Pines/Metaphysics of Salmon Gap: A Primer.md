# Metaphysics of Salmon Gap: A Primer
This is a brief guide to the metaphysics behind mages and exalts. Please note
that pretty much no one, except for mages at the pinnacle of their craft, and
*maybe* a particularly clever Sidereal or two, is actually aware of any of this
in-character - this is all unknown background info.
## Mages
### What is a Mage?
A mage is a human who has undergone an Awakening, and may now perform acts of
magic to bend the universe to their will.

### What is an Awakening?
An awakening is a moment where a potential mage is exposed to magic, and reality
briefly gets a little bit flexible. These are often likely to be traumatic, or
at least life-altering, events.

In this campaign, all player character mages had their awakening in the first
session, when we fell into the Mountain through the hole at the base of the
Salmon Bear statue.

### How does Magic work?
At the most fundamental level, magic is your ability to tell reality to do
something outside the normal realm of physics and chemistry and cause-and-effect.
Magic is powered by belief - you believe that a certain set of actions, whatever
you chose for your paradigm and implements, is capable of changing reality. For
this reason, mage as a game is less about learning how to do magic, but about
realizing that you always knew how to do it all along.

Because magic is powered by belief, things that are easier to believe are easier
to magic. For instance, it's easy to reach into the pocket you previously
thought was empty, and pull out a car key - it *might've* always been in the
pocket, after all. It's a bit harder to hold your hand out and teleport a car
key into your hand, because it's pretty clear that something supernatural just
happened, and it's much harder to teleport a car key into your hand in front of
non-mages - non-mages don't believe in magic, so they don't believe in *your*
magic, and their belief acts against yours.

### What is Paradox?
If magic is all about the belief that you can change reality, then paradox is
when reality smacks you on the wrist with a wooden spoon for trying to mess it
up. Not only are truly reality-bending spells harder to cast, but they can cause
you to gain paradox, which can have nasty effects.

### What is Quintessence?
Quintessence is basically magical energy, ready for the taking. It can be pulled
out of certain locations (which have ten million names, from Nodes to Dragon
Nests to... whatever), and some skilled mages can pull it out of other stuff too.
Its main use is to make magic easier.

### What is an Avatar?
Remember how I said that mage is all about learning that you always knew magic
all along? Well, your avatar is the entity trying to teach you that. All mages
have an avatar of some kind. It could be as ephemeral as a figure you sometimes
see in a crowd that leads you to something interesting, or a radio station that
you can only sometimes seem to manage to tune into. It could be as concrete as a
possessed furby or a weird goat that stalks you sometimes. The only strict
criteria for an avatar is that it is some force, entity, creature, or phenomenon,
that it has an agenda, and that its agenda is teaching you magic.

There is also a throwaway line in the mage book that implies that avatars are
what's left of several Sidereal exaltations that have been ground down by eons
of use; this will be elaborated on later.

## Exalts
### What is an Exalt?
An exalt is a human or demi-human who has a magical super-weapon, called an
Exaltation, grafted onto their soul.

### What is an Exaltation?
An exaltation is a magical super-weapon, intended to convert the person it
attaches to into a god-killing super-soldier. Fortunately, the world is a lot
less magical than it was when exaltations were made, so instead of having powers
on tier with god-killing, they're just monster-killing instead.

Different exaltations were made by different creators, and will attach
themselves to different types of people. Below is a brief overview of the
relevant types of exaltation in this campaign; there are more that aren't listed.

#### Alchemical Exaltation (Max)
Alchemical exaltations were made by the machine god, Autochthon. Unlike every
type of exaltation, these actually have a physical form - when not attached to
someone, they appear as a small rock or gemstone. Rather than seek out specific
hosts, they wait until someone touches them, at which point they fuse with the
person who did so.

Typically, it's easiest to think of Alchemical exalts as magic-powered cyborgs.
They don't look human by default, but most Alchemicals are smart enough to use
the particular ability that lets them pass as a mundane human. Alchemical powers
have a wide range of effects, but manifest as techno-magical implants.

#### Liminal Exaltation (Spider)
Liminal exaltations were made by an unknown deity associated with the underworld
and/or death. Unlike every other type of exaltation, these do not attach
themselves to living humans. Instead, whenever someone tries to bring a corpse
to life - whether through failed resurrection rituals, turning them into a
vampire, or some other means - the corpse will sometimes rise as a Liminal
instead. Liminal exalts will have the memories of the person intended to be
raised, but will not consider those memories to be their own, and will consider
themselves to be a different person.

Liminal exalts tend to have a persistent illusion/glamour about them that makes
them indistinguishable from other humans, but certain actions can cause that
glamour to fail and reveal the Frankenstein's Monster underneath. They tend to
have a very wide variety of powers, most of which are macabre in either their
use or their results.

#### Sidereal Exaltation (Summer, originally)
Sidereal exaltations were made by a set of five goddesses of fate. Sometimes,
when someone has a particularly impactful destiny, a Sidereal exaltation will
seek them out and attach itself to them without their knowing. In the process,
it will consume their original fate, leaving behind superpowers as a consolation
prize.

Sidereal exalts tend to have powers that let them bend the fourth wall, from
getting hints about what's coming next, to having infinite ammo as long as they
aren't counting bullets, to LARPing and making the universe believe the act.
However, these powers come with the downside that Sidereals slip out of people's
memory - they're fate's stagehands, not fate's actors.

#### Getimian Exaltation (Summer, presently)
Getimian exaltations were made in a bygone era by a powerful Sidereal exalt, as
walking holes in reality that he could use to make an army against other
Sidereals. Much like the Sidereal exaltations, they seek out people with
impactful destines, but they don't stop at eating the original destiny - they
make it as if the exalt never existed, or rip the exalt out of one reality and
put them in a different reality where they never were.

Getimian exalts tend to have powers that are like a dark mirror of Sidereals',
with less manipulation of fate and future and more manipulation of reality and
the present. Getimians also slip out of people's minds, like Sidereals, and
because of how they're erased from reality come with even more baked-in angst.

#### What the hell is up with Summer?
Being a Sidereal exalt fit her better than being a mage, and being a Getimian
fit her better than being a Sidereal. Our gracious GM was kind enough to let me
change her as those resources became available (they weren't at first), and come
up with an in-universe reason for the change rather than just retcon it. The
exact details of what's going on with her are secret, even to me, but my best
hypothesis is that her existence has been splintering, and that each step in the
change has been her becoming a little less "real".

### What is Limit?
All exaltations are flawed. Each type of exaltation has its own unique flaw, but
at core, they're all broken in some way. This is represented with Limit. All
Exaltations have certain types of events that cause them to gain Limit. If their
Limit ever reaches 10, some kind of Bad Thing will happen to the exalt, and
their limit will reset.
