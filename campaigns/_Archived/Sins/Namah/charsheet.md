## Traits, Drawbacks, & Favored Classes
### Oblivious (Drawback)
You take a –2 penalty on Sense Motive and sight-based Perception checks.
### Unorthodox Method (Regional)
Instead of gaining the Scarlet Throne discipline as a Harbinger, gain the Black
Seraph discipline.
### Wicked Leader (Social)
You gain a +1 trait bonus on Charisma-based checks against evil creatures. If
you select the Leadership feat or the Vile Leadership feat at any point when you
meet the prerequisites for that feat, you can recruit a cohort who is up to 1
level lower than you (instead of the normal requirement that your cohort must be
2 or more levels lower than you are) as long as your cohort is evil.
### Horrifying Mind (Magical)
When a non-evil humanoid attempts to read your mind via a magical effect, the
reader must attempt a Will save opposed by your Charisma check. If the reader
fails this save, she is shaken for 1 round. If she fails by 10 or more, she is
instead frightened for 1 round, then shaken for 1 round.
### Favored Class: Warlord VI
Gain +1/5 of a combat feat per rank.

## Racial Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, you have a movement speed of 40 feet, and you can see in
complete darkness (including magical darkness), but are completely colorblind.
You are a native outsider.
### Soul-Sight
You are permanently under the effect of Deathwatch. You can instantly tell
whether any creatures you can see within 30 feet are dead, fragile (<=3 HP),
injured (>=4 HP), healthy, undead, or neither alive nor dead, and Knowledge
(Planes) is always a class skill for you.
### Wings
You are permanently under the effect of a nonmagical featherfall, and may glide
5 feet horizontally per 1 foot vertical (for an overland speed of 60 feet per
round). You gain +4 to Fly checks, and Fly is always a class skill for you.

## Mythic Marshal Features
### Hard to Kill
Whenever you’re below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing
to attempt a Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows you to act
while below 0 hit points, you still lose hit points for taking actions, as
specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to lose hit points when
below 0 hit points. In addition, you don’t die until your total number of
negative hit points is equal to or greater than double your Constitution score.
### Mythic Power
Each day, you can expend an amount of mythic power equal to 3 plus double your
mythic tier (5/day at 1st tier, 7/day at 2nd, etc.). This amount is your maximum
amount of mythic power. If an ability allows you to regain uses of your mythic
power, you can never have more than this amount.
### Surge
You can call upon your mythic power to overcome difficult challenges. You can
expend one use of mythic power to increase any d20 roll you just made by rolling
1d6 and adding it to the result. Using this ability is an immediate action taken
after the result of the original roll is revealed. This can change the outcome
of the roll. The bonus die gained by using this ability increases to 1d8 at 4th
tier, 1d10 at 7th tier, and 1d12 at 10th tier.
### Amazing Initiative
At 2nd tier, you gain a bonus on initiative checks equal to your mythic tier. In
addition, as a free action on your turn, you can expend one use of mythic power
to take an additional standard action during that turn. This additional standard
action can’t be used to cast a spell. You can’t gain an extra action in this way
more than once per round.
### Path Abilities
#### Marshal's Order - Advance (Ex)
As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to inspire a tactical
advance on the field of battle. This allows you and each of your allies within
30 feet to take either a single move action of the character’s choice or a
5-foot step, as long as you or your ally has the ability to take such an action
(for example, an unconscious character still can’t take an action). The action
granted by this ability doesn’t count toward the number or type of actions a
creature is allowed to take on its turn.
#### Lend Power (Su)
As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power or your
confidence ability to grant the benefit of your surge ability to a mythic ally
within 30 feet. The ally uses your surge die.
#### Focus (Su)
Whenever a mythic ally that is within 30 feet uses the surge ability, it rolls
its bonus die twice and takes the higher result.
### Mythic Feats
#### Mythic Combat Reflexes
You can make any number of additional attacks of opportunity per round. As a
swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to, until the start of your
next turn, make attacks of opportunity against foes you’ve already made attacks
of opportunity against this round if they provoke attacks of opportunity from
you by moving.

## Class Features: Harbinger
### Accursed Will (Ex)
Gain a +2 (1/2 INT modifier) insight bonus to attack rolls.
### Dark Claim (Su)
As a swift action, Claim an opponent you can detect within 40 (25 + 5/2 levels)
feet. Claims last for 3 (1/2 level) rounds, and you may Claim at most 4
(INT mod) enemies at a time. Claimed creatures provoke attacks of opportunity
even when using the Withdraw action, and you always know their location (though
concealment still applies if you can no longer see them.) You also recover a
single maneuver* when Claiming an enemy, and recover four (INT mod) when a
Claimed enemy is reduced to 0 HP. (*Increased to two by feat)
### Ill Tidings (Ex)

## Class Features: Vanguard Commander Warlord
### Warlord's Gambit (Ex)
A gambit must be started as a swift or immediate action. You may add a +3
(Half CHA) luck bonus to any d20 roll made as part of a gambit. If you succeed
on the gambit, you restore 6 (CHA) maneuvers except for any used during the
gambit, and an additional benefit based on the gambit. If you fail, recover a
single maneuver and take a -2 penalty to all d20 rolls for one round.
