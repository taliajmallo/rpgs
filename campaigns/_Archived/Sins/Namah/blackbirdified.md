## Secrets
### Secret of Soul-Sight
Your eyes see the brightness of souls and vital energy, not light. You are immune to the effects of darkness, bright light, and visual illusions, and may tell if an entity you see is living, dead, nonliving, or undead. However, you are completely colorblind.
### Secret of the Combat Trance
High stress and magical compulsions cause you to enter a dissociative trance, where you become a stone-hearted warrior. While in the trance, you add +1d to any roll involving violence or cruelty, but subtract -1d from any roll involving communication or empathy, and when the trance ends you forget everything you did during it.

## Keys
### Key of Kindness
You don't like to see anyone suffer, even enemies. Turn this key when you help someone who is in trouble or when you change someone's life for the better.
### Key of Naivete
You are easily fooled and misled. Turn this key whenever your naivete causes trouble for you, or is important to a scene.
### Key of Envy
The aspect of envy whispers constantly in your mind of the suffering you've unfairly borne and the weaknesses you're afflicted with, warping admiration into resentment. Turn this key whenever you lash out at someone you respect.
