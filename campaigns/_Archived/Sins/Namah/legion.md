# Dawn Legion
## Background
The Dawn Legion is an elite organization within the Sunset Invaders' military. 
It selects recruits largely based on their likelihood of surviving training, 
which includes brutal conditioning and magical indoctrination to improve their 
efficacy as soldiers. Legionnaires often fight under the the influence of 
compulsion spells, so as to reduce their risk of defecting or being magically 
influenced by the enemy. 

The Dawn Legion is known among the Acyran empire and surrounding lands as a 
merciless force of destruction. Without exception, they fight until either force
is utterly eradicated; any who surrender are given the mercy of a clean death, 
and any who retreat are unerringly hunted down. 

While most unsuccessful recruits die to their training, there are some who 
narrowly survive but are left unfit for duty. Such individuals usually find 
themselves permanently marked by their training, and may unintentionally slip in 
and out of their conditioned state. Actual ex-legionnaires are exceedingly rare; 
the few who do not die in service to the legion usually find employment training 
younger members. 

## Core Tenants
- I shall neither ask nor grant mercy. Any who draw a blade against the Legion must be slain by the Legion. 
- My desires are secondary to the good of my order, my nation, and my people. They will not distract me from my tasks.
- My discipline is my honor. I shall obey the commands of my order, even at the cost of my own life. 
- I will be a paragon of might â€” an unassailable example that others might follow. 

## Notes
Any Pathfinder material referencing the Hell Knights or Grey Maidens is 
appropriate to apply to the Dawn Legion as well, and affiliation with the Dawn
Legion is considered to be affiliation with the Hell Knights and Grey Maidens
for the purposes of qualifying for feats or prestige classes.
