# Namah's Grey Maiden Training

## Champion (Str)
### Spirit Bonus
Attack rolls, non-spell damage rolls, Strength checks and skills, 
Fortitude saves
### Seance Boon
You gain a +2 bonus on all non-spell damage rolls.
### Influence Penalty
Take a penalty to Intelligence checks and skills, as well as caster level, equal
to your spirit bonus. This can reduce the max level of spells you can cast. 
### Lesser Power
You gain proficiency in all martial weapons and in one exotic weapon of your 
choice, Which you choose each time you channel a champion spirit. 
<!-- ### Intermediate Power
Whenever you take a full attack action, you gain an additional attack at your 
highest base attack bonus. This stacks with Haste, but not with special actions
such as flurry of blows or spell combat.  -->
<!-- ### Greater Power
You can take a swift action and a full-round action to move up to your speed and
then make a full attack. This does not combine with your intermediate power. As
soon as you begin moving, you are considered to have begun the full-round action,
even if you are prevented from finishing your movement.  -->
<!-- ### Supreme Power
You gain two combat feats of your choice each time you access this spirit. You
can treat your BAB as your medium level for qualifying for these feats and
determining their effects, and you can count your medium levels as levels in one
other class whose BAB equals its class level for the purpose of qualifying for 
these feats.  -->

## Guardian (Con)
### Spirit Bonus
AC, Constitution checks, Fortitude saves, Reflex saves
### Seance Boon
+1 Bonus to CMD
### Influence Penalty
Take a penalty on damage rolls equal to your spirit bonus. 
### Lesser Power
You gain proficiency in heavy armors and shields (including tower shields).
<!-- ### Intermediate Power
You gain DR/— and resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic equal 
to 1/2 your medium level. Add paladin’s sacrifice to your medium spells known as 
a 2nd-level spell. -->
<!-- ### Greater Power
After an enemy's attack would hit you or an adjacent creature, you can use 
spirit surge to increase the victim's AC, possibly causing the attack to fail. 
You cannot use this if flat-footed or unaware. If this causes the attack to miss,
you can make a single attack against that enemy as a bonus action.  -->
<!-- ### Supreme Power
Once per day as an immediate action, you can ignore the effects of a single 
attack against you, including enemy spells targeting you or whose area or effect
includes you. The attack affects other creatures as normal. -->

## Marshal (Cha)
### Spirit Bonus
Charisma checks and skills, spirit surge rolls.  
### Seance Boon
Choose any other spirit's seance boon. When using the shared seance class 
feature, each participant may choose a different boon. 
### Influence Penalty
Take a penalty equal to your spirit bonus to all Wisdom checks and skills. If
you are not at least nominally in charge of your present allies, you lose your 
spirit bonus and seance boon. 
### Lesser Power
You can use your spirit surge on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, 
concentration checks, and skill checks rolled by you or any allies who 
participated in your seance as long as you have line of sight and line of effect, 
and are within 30 feet of the chosen ally. You can still use spirit surge only 
once per round.
<!-- ### Intermediate Power
As a standard action, you can grant all allies who can see and hear you a 
competence bonus equal to your spirit bonus on either saving throws or attack 
and damage rolls. You choose which bonus to grant each time you use inspiring 
call. This ability lasts for 1 round. If you have your greater power, this is a 
move action instead, and if you have your supreme power, this is a swift action.  -->
<!-- ### Greater Power
You can spend one use of superior training as a swift action to allow an ally 
within 30 feet who can see and hear you to make a single melee or ranged attack 
during your turn. You can use this ability as a standard action to instead allow 
the ally to perform any standard action. -->
<!-- ### Supreme Power
You can use a weaker version of superior training without expending daily uses. 
This adds a maximum of 1d6 to the roll and does not apply your spirit bonus, 
regardless of other effects or abilities you have that alter superior training. 
This still counts as superior training for the purpose of the limit of one 
superior training per round. -->
