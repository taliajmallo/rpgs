## Dual-Cursed Mistwalker Features
### Primary Curse: Mist-Touched Vision
### Secondary Curse: Branded
You have a visible scar on your forehead that depicts a mystical symbol of some 
significance to Shelyn. You had no choice in the matter; the brand appeared with 
fire and searing pain. Your brand cannot be disguised or altered, even with 
magic, although you can still benefit from cover or concealment, and you can 
cover it by wearing a hood. Some NPCs may recognize the brand and become hostile, 
per the GMâ€™s choice. 
As a supernatural ability, you can touch an enemy for 1d6 + (1/2 your curse level) 
fire damage; any opponent who takes damage bears your symbol until an equal 
amount of damage is healed. Any branded opponent takes -2 to save versus your 
spells and spell-like abilities. You can perform this branding touch a number of 
times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma bonus (minimum 1).

## Fractured Mind Features

## Feats 
### Eldritch Blending (1st)
Consolidate your spell point pools into a single joint pool. 
### Phantom Fighter (Antihero 1st)
Your phantom's natural weapons are treated as having the ghost touch property. 
In addition, when you cast a touch spell to be delivered by your phantom, you 
can modify the spell as if you possessed the Ectoplasmic Spell metamagic feat.
