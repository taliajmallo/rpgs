## Talents
### Overkill
On any panic roll result of 11+, if you have enemies within sight, you may elect
to replace the effect of the panic roll with an Overkill effect. This forces you
to attack all enemies within sight and not stop until you or they are all Broken.
Additionally, other players within SHORT range must make an immediate panic roll.
### Merciless
You may perform a coup de grace without rolling Empathy. Also, your Stress Level
is decreased by one step each time you cause an enemy to be Broken.
### Ether Junkie:
Due to repeated exposure to Ether, you find it difficult to resist taking more.
When you come into contact with any new ether pills, make a base wits check. If
you fail, you must immediately do your best to get a hold of and take another
pill if possible. You may try to be sneaky about it, but this goal takes
precedent over any other immediate plans.
Due to the effects of ether, your body is exceptionally strong but no longer
heals as well as it used to. In order to regain any health, you must first
complete a full uninterrupted 24 hours of rest.
