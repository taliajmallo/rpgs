## Familiar Properties
### Improved Evasion
Sigrissa takes half damage on failed reflex saves, and no damage on 
successful reflex saves. 
### Share Spells
You can cast spells with a target of "You" on Sigrissa, and may cast spells on 
Sigrissa even if they would not normally affect Magical Beasts. 
### Empathic Bond
While within a mile of Sigrissa, you can communicate empathically with her (but
cannot see through her eyes or any such ability). Only emotions can be shared.  
### Deliver Touch Spells
If Sigrissa is in contact with you when you cast a spell with a range of touch,
or any time you cast a hex with a range of touch, you can designate Sigrissa as 
the "toucher", and she can deliver the touch spell. 


## Feats
### Deceitful
Gain +2 to Bluff & Disguise (+4 if you have 10 ranks).
### Additional Traits
#### Family Trade
Bluff is a class skill for you, and if a family member with the Family Trade 
trait is within 60 feet of you, gain a +2 trait bonus to Bluff checks. 
#### Cunning Liar (Bluff)
You can use Intelligence or Wisdom instead of Charisma for Bluff checks.
