## Stats

## Midnight Caste Properties
### Commander of the Risen
For one mote, the Midnight's anima leaps from her hand to a corpse she's
touching, reanimating it as a zombie under her command.
### Death's Own Take Heed
For seven motes, the Midnight may command any ghost except one of the Deathlords
to acknowledge her authority as one of Death's Lawgivers. She can make a
persuade or threaten action that is considered to exploit a Major Intimacy of
terrified obedience.
### Patron of the Lost
The Midnight Caste are dark prophets and speakers for the dead, and they hear
the pleas of their subjects. Whenever a ghost or mortal cries out for help,
knowing nobody will answer, and the Midnight would be able to give him aid, she
is instinctively aware of his predicament and location. She can also hear and
reply to the prayers of her worshippers. She never needs to literally listen to
their words and risk distraction; rather, she simply knows what is being asked
of her.
### Abyssal Experience
Inspiring others to uphold one of your Major or Defining Principles in a
significant way; enduring great hardship in the name of a Major or Defining
Intimacy; accomplishing a great deed that furthers a Major or Defining Principle;
spreading reverence for death or the dead; aiding, protecting or advancing the
agendas of other deathknights or ghosts unrelated to the character or Circle.

## Charms
### Bureaucracy
#### Alluring Eloquence Method
- Cost: 1m; Mins: Bureaucracy 1, Essence 1
- Type: Supplemental
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- The smooth tongue of the Abyssal can make any deal sound appealing. She makes a bargain action using (Charisma or Manipulation + Bureaucracy), which gains (Essence or 3, whichever is higher) bonus dice.
#### Sheathed Blade Negotiation Technique
- Cost: 3m; Mins: Bureaucracy 1, Essence 1
- Type: Supplemental
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Alluring Eloquence Method
- The threat of death is but a tool in the arsenal of any well-equipped diplomat. This Charm enhances a threaten action made with any Ability, preventing any characters from developing negative Intimacies towards the Abyssal due to her threats. At worst, she will be perceived as demonstrating a tendency towards cold and rational realpolitik.
- Using this Charm during formal negotiations or similar situations to make threats on behalf of an organization also allows the Abyssal to roll her threaten action using (Charisma or Manipulation + Bureaucracy).

### Integrity
#### Death's Unhesitating Champion
- Cost: 4m; Mins: Integrity 3, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- It can be challenging at times to walk the deathknight's path, abandoning one's former existence and facing the hatred of those who cling to life. By remaining true to her ideals over any fleeting relations with others, the Abyssal ensures she remains on the right path. When she is targeted by social influence opposing one of her Principles, she can activate this Charm to double the Resolve bonus granted by that Principle, as a non-Charm bonus.
#### Heart of Darkness
- Cost: -; Mins: Integrity 3, Essence 1
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Death's Unhesitating Champion
- This Charm hardens the Abyssal's heart to the desperate appeals of the living. When someone attempts to instill her with a positive Tie towards the living, or make any social influence predicated on a connection to, understanding of, or sympathy towards the living, that attempt is penalized by 1 success for every 1 in the roll.
#### Lesser Horrors Scorned
- Cost: 4m; Mins: Integrity 2, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: One scene
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- The living must always fear their inevitable end. Death's Lawgivers have no such concerns. This Charm renders the Abyssal immune to mundane fear and pain for a scene. Magical effects that inflict fear or pain still function against her, but she gains a +2 non-Charm bonus to Resolve against any influence that attempts to inflict or leverage them.
#### Unflinching Devotion Discipline
- Cost: 4m, 1wp; Mins: Integrity 4, Essence 2
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Death's Unhesitating Champion
- No force can tempt the Abyssal from her noble cause. When she would be persuaded to undertake a major or defining task, she can activate this Charm to refuse that influence automatically. The Abyssal can only use Unflinching Devotion Discipline once per story, unless reset by enduring extreme hardship in the name of her Major or Defining Principles.
#### Deathknight's Unswerving Allegiance
- Cost: -; Mins: Integrity 5, Essence 2
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Unflinching Devotion Discipline
- When she purchases this Charm, the Abyssal chooses one Defining Intimacy that represents some adherence to her role as Death's Lawgiver. It may involve devotion to the dead or her Deathlord in particular, hatred of a living person or institution, bringing death to some or all, preserving or honouring the past or something similar. She may treat any social influence that would convince her to act against this Intimacy as unacceptable.
- Any attempt to weaken the chosen Intimacy must be rolled twice, taking the lower result, and even on a success it still does not actually weaken the Intimacy. Instead, it removes this Charm's ability to render any influence opposed to the Intimacy as unacceptable. This lasts until the Abyssal reminds herself of her devotion by undergoing a major or defining task in order to defend or pursue it.
- If the chosen Intimacy is lowered by some means, this Charm ceases functioning until either it is returned to Defining or the Abyssal chooses a new appropriate Intimacy to dedicate herself towards.
#### Blood Before Surrender
- Cost: 1ahl per 1wp; Mins: Integrity 3, Essence 2
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Lesser Horrors Scorned
- Living flesh is weak and easily cast aside. When she would pay Willpower to resist social influence, the Abyssal may instead pay an equal number of aggravated health levels. This may manifest visibly, as wounds open across her body, or as the strength of her body subtly failing.
#### Dark Messiah Style
- Cost: 7+m, 1wp; Mins: Integrity 5, Essence 3
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Indefinite
- Prerequisite Charms: Deathknight's Unswerving Allegiance
- As long as she remains a faithful servant of death, the comforting stasis of the grave protects the Abyssal from harm. This Charm only functions while she remains dedicated to an appropriate Intimacy via its prerequisite, and its mote cost is equal to seven plus her current Resonance. Gaining Resonance forces her to immediately commit extra motes to it or allow the Charm to end.
- While it remains active, Dark Messiah Style protects the Abyssal completely from transformative magic, sorcerous curses, psychic assaults or fiat-level alterations to her destiny. Changing which kind of effects she is immune to requires ending this Charm and reactivating it. She is also protected against any effect that would have an increased effect against creatures of darkness, though in a way that clearly marks her as one. As she catches a glowing sun-blade in her hand, it weeps blood and its light flickers and dies, its holy magic is choked out by the deathknight's dark majesty.
#### Mortality Cast Aside
- Mortality Cast Aside
- Cost: 1 Resonance; Mins: Integrity 5, Essence 4
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Blood Before Surrender, Heart of Darkness
- Though they may serve death, every Abyssal Exalt is marked by a moment where she refused to fall into its embrace. With this Charm, the deathknight does so again. At the moment that her body finally fails and her soul departs to find its next incarnation, she rejects oblivion with all her will, repairing her broken shell and forcing her soul to return to it.
- Any time she dies, the Abyssal can activate Mortality Cast Aside. At the end of the current scene, she heals (Stamina) health levels, that she may walk among the living once more. If she dies from something other than damage, she heals it entirely, such as purging a deadly disease from her body. She can bring herself back even from recurring or uncountable damage, holding her body together through the most catastrophic injuries. Only a deliberate effort to entirely destroy her body, or being killed using magic such as Ghost-Eating Technique, can stop her from restoring herself to life.
- Using this Charm does not come without its costs. Denying death's hold on her gives the Abyssal an automatic point of Resonance, and each death leaves a scar on her body that no magic can heal. More worryingly, if she has already used it (Essence) times or more, the strain of repeatedly standing on the brink of oblivion leaves her with a Minor Derangement appropriate to the way she was killed. Further uses may create new Derangements or increase the strength of existing ones, as appropriate.
#### Void Avatar Prana
- Cost: - (15m, 1wp); Mins: Integrity 5, Essence 4
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Dark Messiah Style
- Death courses through the Abyssal and everything around her, acting as she directs. She can deliberately invoke Resonance Bleed effects of up to the 4-6 level whenever she wishes (though the Storyteller may veto clearly excessive uses of this ability). Any social influence she makes that is supported by such effects doubles the dice or successes awarded from stunts. Once per story, she can spend fifteen motes, one Willpower to trigger a Resonance Eruption of her choice, directed as she wishes.
- Additionally, the Abyssal can kill a mortal with a single touch. This effect has no cost, but requires a difficulty 5 gambit during combat. She simply reaches out to lay a hand on her target, and all life leaves his body.
#### Immortal Malevolence Enslavement
- Cost: -; Mins: Integrity 5, Essence 5
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Mortality Cast Aside, Void Avatar Prana
- The Abyssal consecrates herself to the eternal service of death, and nothing shall break that vow. The Intimacy she swore herself to with Deathknight's Unswerving Allegiance becomes entirely immutable. No matter what may happen to her, or how much she may regret it, no force can reduce that Intimacy below Defining.
- The chosen Intimacy is now an inherent part of the Abyssal's connection to death, so acting against it counts as a defining sin against death. If the chosen Intimacy is a Tie and its subject dies, she may choose to continue remembering him forever, demonstrating an eternal morbid devotion to somebody long dead, or immediately transfer the same emotion to another appropriate target. She can likewise either continue to dwell on or transfer a Principle based on a particular goal that is fulfilled or otherwise becomes inapplicable.
- In exchange for her devotion, the Abyssal is given the privilege of standing beyond the reach of death itself. She no longer needs to rely on cheating it with Mortality Cast Aside; instead, any time she dies, her body and possessions dissolve into wisps of darkness that quickly dissipate. She reforms at midnight, completely uninjured, in a safe location in the Underworld - either a private sanctum of hers if she has one, or somewhere in the depths of the Labyrinth.
- The only way the Abyssal can be permanently slain is with Ghost-Eating Technique or similar magic. She may choose to use Mortality Cast Aside when she dies, before this Charm activates, if being transported to the Underworld would inconvenience her, and no longer risks developing Derangements for doing so.

### Occult
#### Spirit Sensing Technique
- Cost: 3m; Mins: Occult 1, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: One scene
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- Projecting her senses into the realm of ghosts and other spirits, the Abyssal gains the ability to perceive immaterial beings.
#### Scent of Death
- Cost: -; Mins: Occult 2, Essence 1
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Spirit Sensing Technique
- The senses of the Abyssal are finely tuned to notice her fellows. Whenever any creature of darkness is within the range of her senses, including an immaterial one, some uncanny sense informs her of this fact. This also grants her (half Occult, rounded up) automatic successes to Awareness-based rolls to detect such beings.
#### Queen of the Night
- Cost: -; Mins: Occult 2, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Instant
- Prerequisite Charms: Scent of Death
- The Abyssal Exalted stand as the preeminent princes of darkness, and their lessers must bow to them. Whenever she detects another creature of darkness using Scent of Death, the Abyssal rolls (Charisma + Presence) with (Occult) non-Charm bonus dice to instill a Tie of respect towards herself in that character. Any other creatures of darkness she encounters for the remainder of the scene are affected by the same roll.
#### Shadowlands Circle Necromancy
- Cost: -; Mins: Occult 3, Essence 1
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- Drawing ever closer to oneness with the death, the Abyssal initiates into the Shadowlands Circle of necromancy. She gains one necromantic spell for free as her control spell, which may feature in her anima banner, gains a shaping ritual, and can perform necromantic workings.
#### Terrestrial Circle Sorcery
- Cost: -; Mins: Occult 3, Essence 1
- Type: Permanent
- Keywords: None
- Duration: Permanent
- Prerequisite Charms: Any four Occult Charms
- Demonstrating a more unorthodox mystical talent, the Abyssal initiates into the Terrestrial Circle of sorcery. She gains a free spell which functions as her control spell, gains access to sorcerous workings and learns one shaping ritual.

### Thrown
#### Crypt Bolt Attack
- Cost: 5m; Mins: Thrown 2, Essence 1
- Type: Reflexive
- Keywords: None
- Duration: One scene
- Prerequisite Charms: None
- Gathering necrotic energy in her palm to launch at her foes, or firing it from her eyes, the Abyssal is never unarmed. She can produce crypt bolts for the duration of the scene, which use the traits of medium artifact weapons with the thrown (short) and lethal tags.

## Sorcery
### Merits
#### Sage of Three Circles
The sorcerer has studied the Book of Three Circles, and its eerie knowledge has
taken root in her. Once per story, she may cast a sorcery spell she doesn't know,
although she must still meet its prerequisites. Thereafter, she may learn that
spell without a mentor or source. The Storyteller may deem some spells aren't
contained in the book, primarily those newly invented by Second Age sorcerers.
### Control Spells
#### Death of Obsidian Butterflies
Cost: 15sm, 1wp
Keywords: Decisive-only, Perilous
Duration: Instant
Sculpting Essence into volant black glass, the sorcerer unleashes a cascade of
obsidian butterflies. She rolls (Perception + Occult) as an undodgeable
decisive attack applied in a line against enemies out to medium range. This
line is wide enough to strike all opponents within the width of a single range
band and reaches high enough to strike aerial enemies who are at short range
to the ground (medium range enemies in the air can still be targeted by
directing the butterflies to fly along an upward path, rather than a
horizontal one). Battle groups are especially vulnerable to being cut down by
this spell, taking a -2 penalty to Defense against it.
The attack deals raw damage equal to the sorcerer's (Essence + extra successes),
or (Essence + Occult + extra successes) against a battle group. It does not
reset the sorcerer to base Initiative. Scenery made of wood, glass, or other
fragile materials is generally destroyed. After this spell has been cast, the
obsidian butterflies fall to the ground and shatter, creating terrain that may
be hazardous for barefooted characters to traverse—treat as an environmental
hazard inflicting two dice of lethal damage, difficulty 2 to resist with a
(Dexterity + Athletics) roll, and if the character is barefoot, difficult
terrain as well. Any character wearing armored boots can generally ignore the
debris.
A sorcerer who knows Death of Obsidian Butterflies as her control spell gains
(Essence) bonus dice to the spell's attack roll. When her emotions run hot,
butterfly silhouettes rise from her shadow. When she is angry, her fingernails
turn to sharp volcanic glass, making it possible to cut cloth or paper, rend
wood or flesh and other similar stunts.
#### Blood Lash
Cost: 10sm, 1lhl, 1wp
Keywords: None
Duration: Until dismissed
The sorcerer scourges her spirit with a masochistic invocation, forcing blood
from her open wounds to coalesce into a scarlet whip tipped with black barbs.
The whip has direlash traits (ACC +5, DMG +10, DEF +0, OVW 3; Tags: Lethal,
Melee, Natural, Disarming, Grappling, Flexible, Reaching). She halves wound
penalties, rounded down, when attacking, grappling, or parrying with it. This
spell's health-level cost is waived if the sorcerer has any non-bashing damage
in her health track.
The lash gains additional powers as the sorcerer's wound penalty rises:
- −1: Whipped Dog Infliction (3m; Reflexive; Instant): After damaging an enemy, the sorcerer reflexively rolls a threaten action against him. Wound penalties don't apply to it; they're instead converted to bonus dice.
- −2: Endless Crimson Coils (5m; Supplemental; Instant; Uniform): The lash extends to attack out to short range. If the sorcerer grapples an enemy at range, she may pull him to close range or leave him where she is. If she chooses the latter, an ally can free the grappled character from the clinch with a difficulty 3 gambit.
- −4: Bloodthirsty Scarlet Serpent (5m, 1wp; Simple; Instant; Decisive-only): The sorcerer makes a decisive attack as the blood lash grows a terrible fanged maw, draining her victim's vitality. She heals a level of non-aggravated damage for every 3 levels of damage dealt to a living nontrivial enemy, minimum 1. Waive Endless Crimson Coils' and Whipped Dog Infliction's costs. This power can only be used once per scene, unless reset by taking 7+ levels of decisive damage.
A sorcerer with this as her control spell may manipulate her own shed blood.
She can control any blood she sheds until it dries, causing it to move as she
wills. Using the blood to assist in actions provides exceptional equipment
bonuses (Exalted, p. 580). The blood can rarely attempt rolls by itself, but
if the Storyteller deems it possible, the sorcerer rolls normally. This power
has no range limit, but the sorcerer's senses aren't extended through her
blood.
Distortion (Goal Number: 10): The blood lash congeals, inflicting bashing
damage instead of lethal, and losing the Flexible tag. The sorcerer's wound
penalty is treated as one lower for purposes of the lash's powers.
### Shaping Rituals
#### Darkness of the Shadowlands
The sorcerer draws power from shadow and darkness, weaving it into her spells.
Whenever she begins a scene in darkness or shadow heavy enough to qualify as
concealment for attempting stealth, she gains three sorcerous motes, which
last until the end of the scene and can be spent towards any spells she casts.
Additionally, whenever she takes a shape sorcery action to shape a spell while
in stealth, she gains an additional sorcerous mote as long as the spell's
target is unaware of her. She also receives these benefits while under the
night sky during the new moon or Calibration, even without being concealed.
#### Dreams of a Long-Ago Initiation
When the sorcerer sleeps, her player may describe the fragmented visions of
her forgotten past that she dreams about. She recovers no Willpower from
sleep, instead rolling (Wits + Occult) and gaining one sorcerous mote per
success. These motes last until the next time she sleeps, and can be spent
towards any spell she casts. If the sorcerer spends all of the sorcerous motes
granted by a dream casting her control spell, each counts as two motes towards
meeting the spell's cost. Once per story, the sorcerer's player may stunt to
describe her sudden recollection of an event like the current situation, which
she resolved with sorcery. Doing so awards her a number of sorcerous motes
equal to (her Essence x [stunt level + 1]), which last for the duration of the
scene.
