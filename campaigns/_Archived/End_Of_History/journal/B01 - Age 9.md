# Bloomingtide 17th, 8:7 Awakening

Dear Diary,

   Father's out on a trip again. I wish he would let me come with him - I know
it'd be dangerous to go far, but surely I could make it to Belameer if I'm
with him and we're careful? No matter how many books he brings back, it isn't
the same (and I can only re-read the Encyclopedia Omnarki so many times before
I've memorized all there is to know from it).

   In better news, I finally figured out the witchlight cantrip he was trying to
teach me before he left! Mine looks a little different than his - it's... softer
almost, and *way* prettier? His looks like little sparks, and mine is more like
gentle moonlight unless I specifically change the color. Mine's obviously better!
