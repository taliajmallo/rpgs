Max: 1
Continued proximity to necromancy has suffused you with Shyish. Aggressive
animals in your presence gain Animosity towards you, while other animals gain
Fear I towards you. However, undead do not detect you as living, but rather,
perceive you to be undead. Unintelligent undead will not attack you unless
ordered or provoked, and intelligent undead will assume that you are one of them
unless they have reason to expect otherwise.
