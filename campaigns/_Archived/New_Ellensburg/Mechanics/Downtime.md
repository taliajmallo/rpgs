# Downtime
## Calendar System
Each week, players determine what to do with their downtime. Downtime can be 
spent on a variety of activities, ranging from building resources to preparing 
for a job. If a player picks an option other than Rest, they gain the benefits 
of a short rest, and may spend hit dice to restore health. 
Each weekend, players may elect to attempt a job from those available to them.
Players are not required to attempt a job, but some jobs are time-sensitive, and 
going too long without attempting a job may cause players' Wealth or Reputation 
to decrease. 
## Downtime Options
### Rest
You can spend your downtime resting to take a long rest, restoring your health
to full and resetting uses of any class features that require a long rest to 
recharge. 
### Train a Proficiency or Feat
You can spend your downtime training to acquire a new feat, or to gain 
proficiency with a new language, skill, tool, weapon category, or armor category. 
The first time you spend downtime training, choose a feat or proficiency. After
spending 8 weeks of downtime training for a proficiency, or 20 weeks of downtime
training for a feat, permanently gain that proficiency or feat. The next time 
you spend downtime training, pick a new feat or proficiency. 
A character may not train more than three skills per character level, or one 
feat per character level. 
### Increase Wealth
You can spend your downtime working a day job, picking pockets, or otherwise 
obtaining funds. After spending a number of weeks of downtime equal to 1 plus 
your current Wealth on increasing your wealth, permanently increase your Wealth 
by 1 and reset your progress on increasing it. You do not lose progress if your 
Wealth increases or decreases from other effects.
### Increase Reputation
You can spend your downtime meeting people and making contacts. After spending a
number of weeks of downtime equal to 1 plus your current Reputation on 
increasing your Reputation, increase your Reputation by 1 and reset your 
progress on increasing it. You do not lose Networking progress if your 
Reputation increases or decreases from other effects. 
### Prepare for a Job
You can spend your downtime preparing for a job to gain unique advantages, such
as a floor plan or an insider contact. Every job will have a number of 
Opportunities available, each of which will provide some benefit for that job. 
Some opportunities will require skill checks, while others may require spending
Wealth or Reputation. 
### Acquire Rare or Illegal Items
You can spend your downtime finding deals for difficult-to-obtain items. Rare 
goods and common illegal goods require a number of days equal to the item's 
Value, while rare illegal goods require a number of days equal to twice the 
item's Value. Downtime must be spent in 5-day increments, but you can buy more 
than one item per week if time permits, and you may "save" excess days to obtain
a future item more quickly.
