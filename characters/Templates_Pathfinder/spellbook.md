You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how long 
you study a particular area or subject.
- 1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.
- 2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.
- 3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties.
### Read Magic

|--------------------|-|
| Casting            | Action
| Components         | VSF (a clear crystal or mineral prism)

You can decipher magical  inscriptions on objects – books, scrolls, weapons, and 
the like – that would otherwise be unintelligible. This deciphering does not 
normally invoke the magic contained in the writing, although it may do so in the 
case of a cursed or trapped scroll. Furthermore, once the spell is cast and you 
have read the magical inscription, you are thereafter able to read that 
particular writing without recourse to the use of read magic. You can read at 
the rate of one page (250 words) per minute. The spell allows you to identify a 
glyph of warding with a DC 13 Spellcraft check, a greater glyph of warding with 
a DC 16 Spellcraft check, or any symbol spell with a Spellcraft check 
(DC 10 + spell level).
