# Jasskia 
## CE Vishkanya Kineticist (Kinetic Chirurgeon) / VMC Oracle 2
## Appearance & Vital Stats 
From a distance, Jass appears to be a lithe and well-tanned human woman, with a 
tidy braid of black hair that reaches down to her shoulder. However, at a close 
range it's clear that she's one of the scaled Vishkanya of the Bla'kroya dessert, 
peering at the world through the golden eyes of a serpent. 
Jass stands at approximately 5'5", weighing 110 lbs.

## Traits & Drawbacks
### Attached
You have a strong emotional attachment to Cilanthia, your younger sister. 
Whenever she is either threatened, in danger, or in someone else's possession, 
you take a -1 penalty on Will saves and a -2 penalty on saves against fear 
effects. If she is ever lost, killed, or destroyed, exchange this drawback for 
the Doubt drawback. 
### Classically-Schooled
Encouraging Cil's interest in magic meant reading a wide variety of arcane texts.
You gain a +1 trait bonus on Spellcraft checks, and Spellcraft is always a class
skill for you.
### Criminal
You spent your early life robbing and stealing to get by. Select one of the 
following skills: **Disable Device**, ~~Intimidate~~, or ~~Sleight of Hand~~. 
You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you. 
### Vagabond Child
You grew up among the outcasts and outlaws of your society, learning to forage 
and survive in an urban environment. Select one of the following skills - 
~~Disable Device~~, **Escape Artist**, or ~~Sleight of Hand~~. You gain a +1 
trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you. 

## Racial Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, you have a speed of 30 feet, and you can see twice as far 
as a human in low light conditions. 
### Vishkanya Skill Affinities (Limber, Keen Senses)
You have a +2 racial bonus to Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth checks. 
### Vishkanya Poison
You have resistance on saving throws against poison equal to your hit dice, you 
never accidentally poison yourself when using or applying poison, and you may 
envenom a held weapon a number of times per day equal to your CON modifier as a 
swift action. 
*Vishkanya Venom*: Injury; save Fort DC 14 (10 + 1/2 HD + CON mod); frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.

## Class Features
### Elemental Focus (Aether)
Your primary elemental focus is Aether. You add Knowledge (Engineering) and 
Sleight of Hand to your class skill list, and gain the *Basic Telekinesis* 
talent and *Telekinetic Blast* blast.
### Kinetic Blast
As a standard action, you can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a 
range of 30 feet. You must have at least 1 hand free to aim. Kinetic blasts are 
always treated as magic, always deal full damage to swarms, may be readied to 
counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor, and 
have descriptors corresponding to any energy damage type(s) they deal. They 
count as a weapon for feats like Weapon Focus, but you are never considered to 
be holding them, and you cannot use Vital Strike with them. 
- Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal 1d6 + 4 (2+CON Mod) damage, increasing by 1d6 + 1 every odd level. 
- Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal 1d6 + 1 (1/2 CON Mod) damage, increasing by 1d6 every odd level.
### Gather Power
If you have both hands free, you may gather power in a loud and visible display 
to reduce the burn of a blast used immediately after. A move action reduces the 
blast by 1, a full-round action reduces it by 2, and a full-round plus a move 
action reduces it by 3. 
If you take damage between starting to gather power and finishing the blast, 
make a concentration check (DC 10 + Damage taken + effective spell level) or 
gain a negative level that disappears after a day. 
### Kinetic Chirurgery 
You may never gain or use infusions, but instead gain the Kinetic Healing talent
for free at first level. You may use this talent a number of times per day equal
to your CON modifier At third level and every odd level thereafter, gain a
paladin mercy; you may apply a single mercy to any target of Kinetic Healing or 
Healing Burst. 
### Wild Talents
DC 13 (10+CON Mod) + Talent effective spell level
#### Kinetic Healer (Utility, Level 1, Burn 1) 
With a touch, you can heal a willing living creature of an amount of damage 
equal to your kinetic blastâ€˜s damage. Instead of paying the burn cost yourself, 
you can cause the recipient to take 1 point of burn. 
#### Basic Telekinesis (Utility, Level 1, Burn 0)
Modified Mage Hand or Open/Close cantrip: As an action, at a range of 30 feet 
(25 + 5 / 2levels), you may move an unattended object weighing 10lbs (5 per 2 
levels, min 5) up to 30 feet/round as long as concentration lasts. Can instead 
create aetherial container for same weight of fluids, or open/close unsecured 
container/door/ect. 
#### Telekinetic Finesse (Utility, Level 1, Burn -) 
You can perform any sort of fine manipulation you choose within close range, 
including attempting Sleight of Hand and Disable Device checks.
#### Telekinetic Blast (Simple Blast, Level 0, Burn 0)
Throw a nearby unattended object weighing no more than 10 lbs (5/level). On a hit, 
either deal blast damage with your choice of physical damage type, or deal 
damage as if you'd have thrown the object (using CON instead of STR for damage 
roll). To throw a weapon and use its damage, you must be proficient and able to 
wield it one-handed. 
#### Force Ward (Defense, Level -, Burn 0)
You constantly surround yourself with a ward of force. You gain a number of 
temporary hit points equal to your kineticist level. If the damage you take 
from any source is reduced to zero, it is counted as a miss for the purposes
of of abilities that trigger on a hit or miss. The temporary hitpoints 
regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute, and accepting burn from an Aether wild 
talent restores temporary hitpoints equal to your level. 
You may accept burn to empower this. Every point of burn increases the maximum 
temporary HP by half your level, and every two points of burn increase the 
regeneration rate by 1 per minute. 

## VMC Class Features
### Mystery of Life
Divine entities have gifted you with supernatural powers of healing, much to 
your confusion and chagrin. This has no immediate effect. 
### Curse of the Merciful
You are cursed with a supernatural compulsion to render aid to any who request 
it. If a non-enemy character who is adjacent asks you to heal them, or asks you 
for help and you can tell they have taken damage or drain or suffer from a 
disease or poison, you must help them on your next turn. If they have a 
condition or suffer from a poison or disease that you can neutralize or cure 
with any ability you possess or any spell you can cast, you must do so as your 
next action. Otherwise, if they have taken any damage, you must cast a spell or 
use an ability that heals hit points. Also, you cannot perform a coup de grace. 
You gain the ability to lay on hands, as the paladin ability, using your curse 
level (1/2 character level via VMC, +5 at character level 11) as your paladin 
level.
- At 5th curse level (10th character level), you gain a mercy, as the paladin ability.
- At 10th curse level (11th character level), you gain a second mercy, and can exchange your first mercy for a different one.
- At 15th curse level (20th character level), you gain a third mercy, and can exchange one of your existing mercies for a different one.
#### Lay on Hands (Merciful)
You may cure wounds with a touch 2 (1/4 character level + CHA mod) times per day, 
healing 1d6 (1d6 / 4 character levels, min 1d6) damage. This is a standard 
action when used on another target, or a swift action when used on yourself.
