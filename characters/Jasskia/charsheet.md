# Jasskia 
## CE Changeling Kineticist (Kinetic Chirurgeon/Dark Elementalist) / VMC Oracle 3 
## Appearance & Vital Stats 
From a distance, Jass appears to be a lithe and well-tanned human woman, with a 
tidy braid of black hair that reaches down to her shoulder. However, at a close 
range it's clear that she's one of the scaled Vishkanya of the Bla'kroya dessert, 
peering at the world through the golden eyes of a serpent. 
Jass stands at approximately 5'5", weighing 110 lbs.

## Traits & Drawbacks
### Attached
You have a strong emotional attachment to Cilanthia, your younger sister. 
Whenever she is either threatened, in danger, or in someone else's possession, 
you take a -1 penalty on Will saves and a -2 penalty on saves against fear 
effects. If she is ever lost, killed, or destroyed, exchange this drawback for 
the Doubt drawback. 
### Classically-Schooled
Encouraging Cil's interest in magic meant reading a wide variety of arcane texts.
You gain a +1 trait bonus on **Spellcraft** checks, and Spellcraft is always a 
class skill for you.
### Criminal
You spent your early life robbing and stealing to get by. Select one of the 
following skills: **Disable Device**, ~~Intimidate~~, or ~~Sleight of Hand~~. 
You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you. 
### Stealthy Escape
When trying to escape manacles, rope, or other similar restraints (but not 
grapples or similar attacks), you may make a Sleight of Hand check instead of 
your Escape Artist modifier. If you free yourself, you gain a +2 trait bonus on 
Bluff checks to pretend that you are still bound.

## Racial Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, you have a speed of 30 feet, and you have darkvision to a 
range of 60 feet. 
### Sea Lungs (Sea Hag Mother)
The changeling may hold her breath for a number of rounds equal to three times 
her Constitution before she risks drowning.
### Hag Magic
Hag Magic: Some changelings develop a gift for spellcasting instead of their 
mothers’ overtly fearsome traits. A changeling with this trait displays one or 
more stark white streaks in her hair as a child. The DCs of any saving throws 
against enchantment spells she casts increase by 1, and if her Charisma score is 
11 or higher, she also gains the following spell-like abilities, usable once per 
day each: dancing lights, detect magic, disguise self, and pass without trace. 
The caster level of these spell-like abilities is equal to the changeling’s 
character level. The DC for these spell-like abilities is equal to 10 + the 
spell’s level + the changeling’s Charisma modifier. 
### Favored Class Bonus - Dark Elementalist Alternate III
Each time you take this benefit, gain +1/3 of a use of Soul Power per day. 

## Class Features
### Elemental Focus (Aether)
Your primary elemental focus is Aether. You add Knowledge (Engineering) and 
Sleight of Hand to your class skill list, and gain the *Basic Telekinesis* 
talent and *Telekinetic Blast* blast.
### Kinetic Blast
As a standard action, you can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a 
range of 30 feet. You must have at least 1 hand free to aim. Kinetic blasts are 
always treated as magic, always deal full damage to swarms, may be readied to 
counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor, and 
have descriptors corresponding to any energy damage type(s) they deal. They 
count as a weapon for feats like Weapon Focus, but you are never considered to 
be holding them, and you cannot use Vital Strike with them. 
- Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal 2d6 + 6 (2+INT Mod) damage, increasing by 1d6 + 1 every odd level. 
- Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal 2d6 + 2 (1/2 INT Mod) damage, increasing by 1d6 every odd level.
### Gather Power
If you have both hands free, you may gather power in a loud and visible display 
to reduce the burn of a blast used immediately after. A move action reduces the 
blast by 1, a full-round action reduces it by 2, and a full-round plus a move 
action reduces it by 3. 
If you take damage between starting to gather power and finishing the blast, 
make a concentration check (DC 10 + Damage taken + effective spell level) or 
take burn. 
### Soul Power (Healing Buffer Variant) 
The maximum burn you can intentionally accept is 3. However, a number of times 
per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (4), as a full-round action you can
gather up souls of sentient creatures with a collective CR equal to or greater 
than your level, and offload 2 burn onto them. This doesn't heal the nonlethal
damage, but does allow you to heal that damage through other means. You may only
offload burn spent on Kinetic Healer and Healing Burst. A soul used in this way
cannot be brought back to life as if it died of a death effect. 
At 6th level, racking a soul in this way forces anyone trying to bring the 
creature back to life to succeed at a caster level check (DC = 10 + level) or 
the attempt fails. At 11th level, even if the creature returns from the dead, 
its soul is so damaged by the agony that it takes 2d6 points of Wisdom damage. 
At 16th level, the soul is destroyed in the process, and the creature can be 
restored only by a miracle or wish.
A dark elementalist gains attack and damage bonuses from elemental overflow 
based on how many times that day she has used soul power to rack a soul, rather 
than based on her current burn total. A dark elementalist does not gain size 
bonuses to physical ability scores or a chance to ignore critical hits and sneak
attacks from elemental overflow.
### Kinetic Chirurgery 
You may never gain or use infusions, but instead gain the Kinetic Healing talent
for free at first level. You may use this talent a number of times per day equal
to your INT Modifier without applying burn.  At third level and every odd level 
thereafter, gain a paladin mercy; you may apply a single mercy to any target of 
Kinetic Healing or Healing Burst. 
### Kinetic Mercies
#### Fatigued 
You may remove fatigue from targets of Kinetic Healer of Healing Burst.
### Wild Talents
DC 14 (10+INT Mod) + Talent effective spell level
#### Kinetic Healer (Utility (Universal), Level 1, Burn 1) 
With a touch, you can heal a willing living creature of an amount of damage 
equal to your kinetic blast‘s damage. Instead of paying the burn cost yourself, 
you can cause the recipient to take 1 point of burn. 
#### Basic Telekinesis (Utility (Aether), Level 1, Burn 0)
Modified Mage Hand or Open/Close cantrip: As an action, at a range of 30 feet 
(25 + 5 / 2levels), you may move an unattended object weighing 10lbs (5 per 2 
levels, min 5) up to 30 feet/round as long as concentration lasts. Can instead 
create aetherial container for same weight of fluids, or open/close unsecured 
container/door/ect. 
#### Telekinetic Finesse (Utility (Aether), Level 1, Burn -) 
You can perform any sort of fine manipulation you choose within close range, 
including attempting Sleight of Hand and Disable Device checks.
#### Telekinetic Blast (Simple Blast, Level 0, Burn 0)
Throw a nearby unattended object weighing no more than 10 lbs (5/level). On a 
hit, either deal blast damage with your choice of physical damage type, or deal 
damage as if you'd have thrown the object (using CON instead of STR for damage 
roll). To throw a weapon and use its damage, you must be proficient and able to 
wield it one-handed. 
#### Force Ward (Defense, Level -, Burn 0)
You constantly surround yourself with a ward of force. You gain a number of 
temporary hit points equal to your kineticist level. If the damage you take 
from any source is reduced to zero, it is counted as a miss for the purposes
of of abilities that trigger on a hit or miss. The temporary hitpoints 
regenerate at a rate of 1 per minute, and accepting burn from an Aether wild 
talent restores temporary hitpoints equal to your level. 
You may accept burn to empower this. Every point of burn increases the maximum 
temporary HP by half your level, and every two points of burn increase the 
regeneration rate by 1 per minute. 
### Overflow
For every Soul Burn used today, up to a maximum of 1/3 of your 
Kineticist level, you gain +1 to attack rolls with kinetic blasts and +2 to 
damage or healing dealt with blasts, Kinetic Healer, or Healing Burst. 


## VMC Class Features
### Mystery of Life
Divine entities have gifted you with supernatural powers of healing, much to 
your confusion and chagrin.
### Curse of the Merciful
You are cursed with a supernatural compulsion to render aid to any who request 
it. If a non-enemy character asks you to heal them, or asks you for help and you 
can tell they have taken damage or drain or suffer from a disease or poison, you 
must help them on your next turn. If they have a condition or suffer from a 
poison or disease that you can neutralize or cure ith any ability you possess or 
any spell you can cast, you must do so as your next action. Otherwise, if they 
have taken any damage, you must cast a spell or use an ability that heals hit 
points. Also, you cannot perform a coup de grace. 
You gain the ability to lay on hands, as the paladin ability, using your curse 
level (1/2 character level via VMC, +5 at character level 11) as your paladin 
level.
- At 5th curse level (10th character level), you gain a mercy, as the paladin ability.
- At 10th curse level (11th character level), you gain a second mercy, and can exchange your first mercy for a different one.
- At 15th curse level (20th character level), you gain a third mercy, and can exchange one of your existing mercies for a different one.
#### Lay on Hands (Merciful)
You may cure wounds with a touch 2 (1/4 character level + CHA mod) times per day, 
healing 1d6 (1d6 / 4 character levels, min 1d6) damage. This is a standard 
action when used on another target, or a swift action when used on yourself. 
### Revelation: Life Link
As a standard action, you may create a bond between yourself and another 
creature. Each round at the start of your turn, if the bonded creature is 
wounded for 5 or more hit points below its maximum hit points, it heals 5 hit 
points and you take 5 hit points of damage. You may have a single bond active at 
a time, plus an additional bond for every level after 5th. This bond continues 
until the bonded creature dies, you die, the distance between you and the other 
creature exceeds medium range, or you end it as an immediate action (if you have 
multiple bonds active, you may end as many as you want as part of the same 
immediate action).

## Feats 
### Healer's Touch (205 / 1000)
After curing a cumulative total of 1000 points of damage, plus 2 for every point 
of damage dealt, your Kinetic Healer ability talent always restores its maximum
possible hitpoints when used on a target other than yourself. 
### Mystic Healer
Add additional dice to any form of healing you generate. This starts as +1d4, 
increasing to 1d6 at 4th level, 2d6 at 7th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at
13th level.
