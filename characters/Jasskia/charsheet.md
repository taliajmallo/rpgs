## Traits & Drawbacks
### Attached
You have a strong emotional attachment to your younger sister. Whenever she is either threatened, in danger, or in someone else's possession, you take a -1 penalty on Will saves and a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects. If she is ever lost, killed, or destroyed, exchange this drawback for the Doubt drawback. 
### Arcane Dabbler
Select two non-harmful arcane cantrips. You can cast these two cantrips (*Detect Magic*, *Read Magic*) once per day each (caster level 1st). If you have levels in a class that can cast these cantrips, your caster level for these cantrips is equal to that class level.
### Criminal
You spent your early life robbing and stealing to get by. Select one of the following skills: **Disable Device**, ~~Intimidate~~, or ~~Sleight of Hand~~. You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you. 
### Vagabond Child
You grew up among the outcasts and outlaws of your society, learning to forage and survive in an urban environment. Select one of the following skills - ~~Disable Device~~, **Escape Artist**, or ~~Sleight of Hand~~. You gain a +1 trait bonus on that skill, and it is always a class skill for you. 

## Racial Features
### Base Properties
Your size is medium, you have a speed of 30 feet, and you can see twice as far as a human in low light conditions. 
### Vishkanya Skill Affinities (Limber, Keen Senses)
You have a +2 racial bonus to Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth checks. 
### Vishkanya Poison
You have resistance on saving throws against poison equal to your hit dice, you never accidentally poison yourself when using or applying poison, and you may envenom a held weapon a number of times per day equal to your CON modifier as a swift action. 
*Vishkanya Venom*: Injury; save Fort DC 11 (10 + 1/2 HD + CON mod); frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dex; cure 1 save.

## Class Features
### Mind over Matter
Use CHA instead of CON for all kineticist abilities. Add Bluff and Diplomacy to your list of class skills. 
### Elemental Focus (Aether)
Your primary elemental focus is Aether. You add Knowledge (Engineering) and Sleight of Hand to your class skill list, and gain the *Basic Telekinesis* talent and *Telekinetic Blast* blast.
### Kinetic Blast
As a standard action, you can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. You must have at least 1 hand free to aim. Kinetic blasts are always treated as magic, always deal full damage to swarms, may be readied to counterspell any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor, and have descriptors corresponding to any energy damage type(s) they deal. They count as a weapon for feats like Weapon Focus, but you are never considered to be holding them, and you cannot use Vital Strike with them. 
Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal 1d6 + 5 (2+CHA Mod) damage, increasing by 1d6 + 1 every odd level. Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal 1d6 + 2 damage, increasing by 1d6 every odd level.
You may use infusions to modify the properties of your blast, so long as the total burn when cast is zero.
### Gather Power
If you have both hands free, you may gather power in a loud and visible display to reduce the burn of a blast used immediately after. A move action reduces the blast by 1, a full-round action reduces it by 2, and a full-round plus a move action reduces it by 3. 
If you take damage between starting to gather power and finishing the blast, make a concentration check (DC 10 + Damage taken + effective spell level) or gain a negative level that disappears after a day. 
### Wild Talents
DC 14 (10+CHA Mod) + Talent effective spell level
#### Basic Telekinesis (Utility, Level 1, Burn 0)
Modified Mage Hand or Open/Close cantrip: As an action, at a range of 110 feet (100 + 10/level), you may move an unattended object weighing 5lbs (5/2 level, min 5) up to 30 feet/round as long as concentration lasts. Can instead create aetherial container for same weight of fluids, or open/close unsecured container/door/ect. 
#### Telekinetic Blast (Simple Blast, Level 0, Burn 0)
Throw a nearby unattended object weighing no more than 5 lbs (5/level). On a hit, either deal blast damage with your choice of physical damage type, or deal damage as if you'd have thrown the object (using CHA instead of STR for damage roll). To throw a weapon and use its damage, you must be proficient and able to wield it one-handed. 
#### Extended Range (Form Infusion, Level 1, Burn 1) 
When using this infusion, your kinetic blast can strike any target within 120 feet.

## Feats 
### Point-Blank Shot
You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.
