# Jasskia's Journal
## Session 1
### April 27, 957 
Disembarked at Viridia with Pyra. Here's hoping this job goes smoother than my 
last abroad; I'd quite rather avoid being run out of town again. Asked around 
town about our mark, and were sent into some mines. Pyra's disguising herself as 
a halfling and calling herself Amelie. I think she's a bit overcautious, but 
whatever makes her happy?
We joined parties with who we think is our mark, a clearly *insane* 
kobold child and paladin. Haven't yet had a chance to determine whether his 
ornate sword is the one we're after. His party is investigating an unearthed 
dungeon defended by duergar, but we dealt with the first batch pretty handily. 
A couple rooms later, Pyra and I were knocked out by a duergar alchemist, but 
the druid in the party was able to revive us with some potions of healing. We 
claimed a decent chunk of loot and wealth. A handful of other insignificant 
encounters followed. 
## Session 2
#### April 28, 957

## Campaign Notes
### Companions
#### Pyraloid - Ratfolk Oracle of the Streets / VMC Gunslinger
Pyra is a business partner of mine. While I'd be hesitant to call her close, 
we've worked together enough that it was prudent to teach her my native language. 
Typically, she gathers the information that I use for my assignments. Currently,
she's going by the alias of Amelie and disguising herself as a halfling. 
#### Braveheart - Kobold Paladin
An adolescent kobold paladin who believes he's a reincarnated halfing hero. I 
have doubts as to his sanity. 
#### Casmar - Human (?) Druid
A (relatively) sane humanoid wearing tons of feathers. Seems to be a druid of 
some skill. 
#### Xulri - Human Barbarian
???
#### Seldana - Elf Investigator
???
### Contacts
#### Cilanthia - Beloved Younger Sister / Wizard-in-Training
Cil is my sweet baby sister. She was only three when I accidentally killed our 
parents, so I've been raising her myself as best I could. I've done everything I
could to make sure she'll have a better life than mine. She's currently abroad 
apprenticed to a master wizard, so I can only hope she'll have a safe and 
successful life far from Garumna and the Locksmiths.  
#### Fabricus - Shady Guildmaster / Head of the Locksmiths
Fabricus is the person I've spent my last decade-and-some of life working for. 
They're the head of the Locksmiths, Garumna's thieves guild, and not someone I 
have any interest in crossing. I'm something of a favorite of theirs, so I'm not
worried for my immediate future, but they're not known for being particularly 
forgiving. 
##### The Locksmiths
The Locksmiths are Garumna's premiere thieves' guild. I made the mistake of 
stealing from a member when I was 15, and they gave me the choice of joining or 
dying. It wasn't a particularly difficult decision. Ever since, I've worked for 
them, doing everything from petty theft to wetwork. I've got mixed feeling on 
the guild as a whole: while I still resent them somewhat for threatening me into
joining, they've treated me fairly by-and-large.  I'd like to leave someday, but
not before I'm certain it won't jeopardize Cil's apprenticeship.
