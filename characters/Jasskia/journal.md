# Jasskia's Journal
## Session 1
### April 27, 957 
Disembarked at Viridia with Pyra. Here's hoping this job goes smoother than my 
last abroad; I'd quite rather avoid being run out of town again. Asked around 
town about our mark, and were sent into some mines. Pyra's disguising herself as 
a halfling and calling herself Amelie. I think she's a bit overcautious, but 
whatever makes her happy?
We joined parties with who we think is our mark, a clearly *insane* 
kobold child and paladin. Haven't yet had a chance to determine whether his 
ornate sword is the one we're after. His party is investigating an unearthed 
dungeon defended by duergar, but we dealt with the first batch pretty handily. 
A couple rooms later, Pyra and I were knocked out by a duergar alchemist, but 
the druid in the party was able to revive us with some potions of healing. We 
claimed a decent chunk of loot and wealth. A handful of other insignificant 
encounters followed. 
## Session 2
### April 27, 957 
We rendezvoused with the rest of the party, and decided to return to the mining 
camp to rest after I exhausted myself patching them up. Pyra and I shared a
tent since we don't particularly trust our companions. 
### April 28, 957
After a rendezvous with the rest of the party, we returned to the mining camp 
and got some rest. I slept in, assisted Pyra in identifying the magic armor we
found (not actually enchanted on their own, but affected by an area spell), 
and caught Xulri coming back to camp bloodied with a deer slung over her 
shoulder. She asked for healing and I was forced by my curse to comply. 
Once everyone was ready, we decided to venture back into the dungeon. Cas's 
bird set off a bear trap, and exposed us to the Duergar waiting invisibly at the
end of the hallway. We managed to survive the ambush, but my injury-prone allies 
required a good bit of healing and several of our foes escaped before we could
execute them. 
Most of the rooms we went through yesterday haven't been changed, beyond minor 
cleaning and whatnot. We stumbled across a pit of corpses, which Seldana 
indicated is atypical for dwarves (they apparently venerate their dead). I'd 
think that we'd have encountered a giant already if there was one here, but I'll
admit that it's a reasonable concern. 
After some more uneventful (re-)exploring, we came across an evil altar that 
Pyra detected a magical aura on top of. I, like a fool, assumed that the aura 
belonged to a magic item, and disturbed the altar to find the item; instead, a 
fiendish dog was summoned. We killed it easily, but I still feel like a bit of a
dunce for falling for such an obvious ploy. 
After slaying the dog, we found what was likely once an office of sorts. The 
escaped Duergar from earlier had joined ranks with some of their allies, and 
fortified themselves to make a last stand. We successfully killed them all, but 
it was a rather hairy fight I'd rather not repeat. Keeping all of these allies 
alive and breathing is an exhausting ordeal. 
## Session 3
## Campaign Notes
### Companions
#### Pyraloid - Ratfolk Oracle of the Streets / VMC Gunslinger
Pyra is a business partner of mine. While I'd be hesitant to call her close, 
we've worked together enough that it was prudent to teach her my native language. 
Typically, she gathers the information that I use for my assignments. Currently,
she's going by the alias of Amelie and disguising herself as a halfling. 
#### Braveheart - Kobold Paladin
An adolescent kobold paladin who believes he's a reincarnated halfing hero. I 
have doubts as to his sanity. 
#### Casmar - Human Druid
A (relatively) sane humanoid wearing tons of feathers. Seems to be a druid of 
some skill. 
#### Xulri - Human Barbarian
She seems injury-prone, but otherwise competent. I'm probably going to end up 
healing her a lot in the coming weeks. 
#### Seldana - Elf Investigator
All things considered, probably the sanest and most well-adjusted member of the 
party. 
### Contacts
#### Cilanthia - Beloved Younger Sister / Wizard-in-Training
Cil is my sweet baby sister. She was only three when I accidentally killed our 
parents, so I've been raising her myself as best I could. I've done everything I
could to make sure she'll have a better life than mine. She's currently abroad 
apprenticed to a master wizard, so I can only hope she'll have a safe and 
successful life far from Garumna and the Locksmiths.	
#### Fabricus - Shady Guildmaster / Head of the Locksmiths
Fabricus is the person I've spent my last decade-and-some of life working for. 
They're the head of the Locksmiths, Garumna's thieves guild, and not someone I 
have any interest in crossing. I'm something of a favorite of theirs, so I'm not
worried for my immediate future, but they're not known for being particularly 
forgiving. 
##### The Locksmiths
The Locksmiths are Garumna's premiere thieves' guild. I made the mistake of 
stealing from a member when I was 15, and they gave me the choice of joining or 
dying. It wasn't a particularly difficult decision. Ever since, I've worked for 
them, doing everything from petty theft to wetwork. I've got mixed feeling on 
the guild as a whole: while I still resent them somewhat for threatening me into
joining, they've treated me fairly by-and-large.	I'd like to leave someday, but
not before I'm certain it won't jeopardize Cil's apprenticeship.
